I'm  dealign with what could be my ost  centralized ecisions yet. For setup  context, we have still nopt received a reposne from the Commission  in  re Exam  1  fuindingas after interum review meeting prior to final call, This i s  a  great thing which was highly praised i n https://github.com/JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/blob/main/2025/Jul/30.md

The  essens of the  qundary stems around how quickly  I want to  tie hte intertweaving knot between all these established  relationships. I'm feeling very rushed  by the impending circumstances, even though I've know about them for  so long and  freatly  prepared.

##  Context

iv;e  started  feelign this way since i went down  the  coffee route to get the last pending  items out in accordance with  centrlaized deadlines. there was one saturday post-submission where I was practically  shaking the hwole day  , constnatlyh  intaking  calories to even moderataely satiate my energy needs  to think. 

I'm  going  to  try tchanign sleep schedules to  get myself back into  a more  coonmfortable place,  btu for the immediate m oment,  I have a very short window to choose and act ont his time. It recovles entirelyt around the last week fo prep we've don in getting WhatCan's  pincedbiel thoughts  into  a  stellar  [prititon]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1mhdxrs/petition_to_close_regsho_loopholes_allowing).
