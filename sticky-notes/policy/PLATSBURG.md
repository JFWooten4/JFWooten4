Buig department building full of miners and rigged with tons of electric

"never snow around the building in the iwnter" due to excess heating

Massive fans and new infrastructure sucking power

ONtario hydroelectric commission as set to supply 1-6μ at 2-3c/KWh

Ommediately began drawing 50μ in consistent load, compeltely overloading the upply contracted or avaliable

Had to rterminate agreement and run back to 8c+ for everyone in the town

Largest single consumer in ear
