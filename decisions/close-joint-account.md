This is something I feel very strong ly needs to be done. SO yeah. I jsut think it;s valuable to walk through this mentally here for records. It's the sort of thing I dont getot experience a lot in life.


The matter in full contextis that she andI had a joint account where wed put our income. While I've transitoined everything back to my own individual account at another bank, she conitues using all of it. Just last few days after a paycheck, she deposited another $500 into the funds, whichs hse doesnt

## Pros

- could gkeep getting extra money
  - partially offsets all the expenses I covered over the years
- helps me think clearly about next steps without overwelming fiscal entanglements
- puts us boht back on the track forindepenedencee
- forces me to make work pay for living costs
  - it's been a cruch supporting nonmarket work
  - I'll need to stop presumign and start affimrming value
  - Same position as most continbutors, in that they need sustaining income - so I an feel alignment easier
- Still a family safety net as needed (no I will not do that government shit)
- removes lingering emotionla context of financial transactions, whch is the reason I closed the fund down in the first place

## Cons

- feels bad
  - idk exactly how but this oddysy has given bme the ability to make feeling chioces, which is sorta fimemme
- not truthful
  - once she presumably changeds the power account on her own after this last autorun, there wont be any shared expenses from here
- will make her pretty sad likely since this is an affirming step of our seperation
- I will need to be very careful that this leaves me on the right track, continuibnng to stay on values over money
- removes that feeling of happiness and validation when we worked ogether towardsa shared financial future

## Call

empty and close it like i said

### Edit

This was the correct call. I nearly had o panic attack which coalesced into a junk binge last night just taking care to remove the last extra interest from last month. I think it's the combination of interacting with banks plus the complex emotional ramifications (in normal forum, which is just the same too much to handle from the fund[^c])

[^c]: Chives' humorous solution to this challenge was to just not give a shit about the people whose money you manage. I think it's hilarious because that's effectively what happens when you charge a management fee on a down year. Any partner fiscal entanglements unfortunately seem to trigger this same mental need to perfect returns despite internal costs.
