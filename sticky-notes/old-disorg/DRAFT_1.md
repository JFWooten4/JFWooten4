### In re musk tenev chat

Tenev talks on the opacity of the VAR vcaluation

Musks response~~ facisoul~~ that the NSCC is jsut “:making up whatever they want.” 

While not compelte ythere, I CONCUR IWTH MUSK’s interpertation after reading dozens of thdosfdsf jsderith filings iwht the COMmission related to margin parctices and wind-down liablities. This is why I asked to see more of the OCC’s (setup befrehadn in occ link comment url) margining caulatuations asurroudngin especially Vars. (See alseo UBS case)

Go into clarifying what;s going on with that, and th explicit equesrt here of any actions and ocmmunications thereunder theraefeter via FOIAapap as nonprofit 501d3
