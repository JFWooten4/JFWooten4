## Title

DUNA Ownership, Governance, and Stewardship of BlockTransfer


## Body

### Preface

First and foremost, information regarding this proposal was presented orally at the [ Custody Conference](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1435315414333788302) today. To account for the delay in publishing this talk, I've set the maximum voting timeframe (to 30 days). 

Generally, I do not like using videos as (primary) sources for governance proposals. Doing so soems sloppy, takes vuch longer to skim, and can't be easily released on  subscription feeds. 

However,the contents of this proprsal have been in the works for two years,and feedback has deen good so far. Moreover, this is a nonbinding sentiment vote to greenlight implementation work. 


### Substance 

I propose to donate all or part of the shares in [BlockTrans Syndicate](https://www.issuers.info/1846058) by the end of the year. this can be done through a standard ownership transfer, encumberment, or assidgnment - based on an implementation I will subsequently propose 

build this year during dist and start biz in 2027

may need to word as trust comitment 'donate'



### Budget 

i do not feel comfortable asking the DUNA for funds allocatohd to this proposal. Once we have sentiment affirmed, it should be a relatively straightforward transfer process with the Syndicate acting as its own agent (as resolved last AGM).

If you would like to show your support monetarily,please consider donating (not tax-exempt) directly to one of my accounts. there is a law firm ive followed aver che years through my preliminary design explorations. 

Based on some minimal searching, they could help go through things all the way to the end for {$X,00}. Again, I don't think this is the best use of DUNA funds because I have a lot of experience configuring corporate forms, which should allow me to complete the task (albeit maybe slowwer and mith a typo like in our Articles). 

This could take some time 









## Vote

### Timeframe

30 days

### Options

- [0] Yes = / Accept
- No/Decline
- 💭 Abstain















Yes — this is exactly the right moment to shift from “discussing” to articulating the mandate.

At this stage you do not want a super-legalistic document.
You want something that reads like a constitutional resolution:

Clear
Serious
Principled
Understandable to voters
Historically durable

Think: foundational charter language, not contract language.

Below is a clean first draft you can react to. We can refine tone later (more formal, more plain, more on-chain style, etc.).

Draft — DUNA Stewardship Mandate Resolution

Title

Resolution to Affirm Stewardship Mandate for Block Transfer Shares


---

Background / Recitals

WHEREAS, the WhyDRS mission exists to advance and protect direct ownership of securities, investor rights, and transparent market infrastructure;

WHEREAS, Block Transfer, Inc. operates as regulated transfer agent infrastructure aligned with these mission objectives;

WHEREAS, long-term mission integrity requires that critical market infrastructure remain protected from private capture, speculative control, or mission drift;

WHEREAS, the founder and current shareholder of Block Transfer has expressed intent to donate all shares of the company into permanent stewardship for the benefit of the WhyDRS mission;

WHEREAS, the DUNA is a legally recognized entity capable of holding assets, including corporate shares, in furtherance of its charitable and governance purposes;


---

Statement of Intent

The purpose of this resolution is to clearly determine whether the DUNA:

• Accepts the responsibility to serve as permanent steward of Block Transfer
• Is willing to become the legal owner of its shares
• Agrees to hold such shares solely in furtherance of mission objectives

This resolution does not execute a transfer of shares.
Rather, it affirms acceptance of the role and authorizes preparation for such transfer.


---

Stewardship Principles

If adopted, the DUNA affirms the following principles:

1. Perpetual Mission Alignment
Any shares received shall be held exclusively to support the WhyDRS mission and public-interest objectives.


2. Non-Extractive Ownership
Ownership shall not exist for private enrichment, speculation, or financial extraction.


3. Protection Against Capture
Shares shall be held and governed in a manner designed to prevent concentration of control inconsistent with mission purposes.


4. Long-Term Stewardship Duty
The DUNA acknowledges this role represents an ongoing governance responsibility extending indefinitely into the future.




---

Resolution

RESOLVED, that the DUNA hereby explicitly affirms its willingness to accept the permanent stewardship role for Block Transfer, Inc.;

RESOLVED, that the DUNA agrees in principle to become the legal owner of all Block Transfer shares upon their donation;

RESOLVED, that such shares shall be held solely in furtherance of the WhyDRS mission and not for private financial gain;

RESOLVED, that the DUNA authorizes the development of appropriate legal, governance, and operational structures necessary to facilitate this stewardship transfer.


---

Effect of Adoption

Adoption of this resolution:

• Confirms acceptance of stewardship responsibility
• Establishes a clear governance mandate
• Authorizes preparation for future share donation and registration

Adoption does not:

• Immediately transfer shares
• Create financial obligations
• Alter current operations of Block Transfer


---

Why this structure works

This draft:

• Focuses on acceptance, not mechanics
• Makes the responsibility explicit
• Creates a permanent historical record
• Avoids premature legal commitments
• Signals seriousness and legitimacy

It reads much closer to a:

> Mission governance charter resolution



than a transaction document — which is exactly what you want for Layer 1.


---

Next step options

From here we can tune it depending on your needs:

We can adjust for:

• More formal / corporate tone
• More DAO-native tone
• Shorter on-chain readable version
• Inclusion of CRT language references
• Alignment with DUNA governance format

OR we can also draft the voter explanation summary that would accompany this resolution.

Just tell me where you want to go next.













Perfect. Good correction.

You're right — this is not a board resolution.
It’s a governance proposal to members.

So it shouldn’t sound like:

> “WHEREAS… RESOLVED…”



That tone implies directors acting under corporate authority.

What you need instead is:

• Clear • Direct • Written to voters • Focused on responsibility • Explicit about what “Yes” means

Let’s rewrite this in proper DUNA vote format.

Draft — DUNA Governance Proposal

Proposal Title

Affirmation of Stewardship Mandate for Block Transfer Shares


---

Summary

This proposal asks whether the DUNA explicitly accepts permanent ownership and stewardship responsibility for Block Transfer, Inc.

A “Yes” vote affirms that the DUNA is willing to become the legal owner of all Block Transfer shares upon donation and to hold them indefinitely in service of the WhyDRS mission.

A “No” vote indicates the DUNA does not wish to accept this responsibility.

This proposal does not execute a transfer of shares. It establishes whether the DUNA accepts the mandate to do so.


---

Background

Block Transfer, Inc. operates as transfer agent infrastructure aligned with the WhyDRS mission of protecting direct ownership and investor rights.

The founder and current shareholder has expressed intent to donate all shares of Block Transfer into permanent mission stewardship rather than retain personal ownership.

Because ownership carries long-term legal and governance responsibility, this decision requires explicit acceptance by the DUNA before any transfer occurs.

To date, there have been general expressions of support. This proposal seeks a clear and formal mandate.


---

What This Proposal Does

If approved, the DUNA affirms that:

1. It accepts permanent stewardship responsibility for Block Transfer.


2. It is willing to become the legal owner of its shares.


3. Any shares received will be held solely in furtherance of the WhyDRS mission.


4. Ownership is not for private enrichment or speculative gain.


5. Appropriate legal and governance structures may be developed to facilitate the transfer.




---

What This Proposal Does NOT Do

This proposal does not:

• Immediately transfer shares
• Create new financial obligations
• Change current operations of Block Transfer
• Finalize tax or structural mechanics

It establishes acceptance of responsibility only.


---

The Question

Should the DUNA explicitly accept permanent ownership and stewardship responsibility for Block Transfer, Inc., and authorize preparation for donation and registration of its shares to the DUNA?


---

Why this version works

This reads like:

• A governance vote • Clear consequences • No faux-corporate tone • No accidental legal overreach • Very understandable to members

It treats voters like:

> People being asked to take on responsibility — not directors executing a transaction.




---

Now, here’s the deeper strategic question:

Do you want this to feel:

1. Neutral and procedural


2. Philosophical and mission-heavy


3. Stark and gravity-focused



Because tone will affect how people emotionally process the responsibility.

Tell me the tone you want, and we’ll refine it exactly to that.
