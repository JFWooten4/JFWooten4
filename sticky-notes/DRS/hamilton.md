Great quotes:
The media couldn’t be more wrong. This is not about memes and childish wasting of our
money. It’s a chance to expose the frauds of modern financial markets, it’s about screwing the
hedge funds that were a part of bankrupting the world in 2008, it’s about people coming
together to find hope in a dark time, it’s about the evolution of the internet hive mind and its
challenge to the status quo. Sure the memes are wonderful, but this is about so much more.
