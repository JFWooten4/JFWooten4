In a frame different fro the needs of the SCF through general public user specialty delegation and autonomy

---

## Sponsors as pub goods fund

but here we have impmentation via pub keys

### Common ground

Can we agree most elidgible projects exist on Github?

### Historic commonaltieis

Compare incentives to the repository rewards in Drips, disucssed previously in meetings

### Compatable benefits

Generalize data with transparent user and repository API; generous free MS API limits

---

Thus we get to Sponsors as delegation votes
