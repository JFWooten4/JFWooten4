okay so we've  got  a p retty privotal  decision here. The mmatter  at hand is whetehr or not to redirect he existing  TAR1  comment  to the oCC's 802 rule  closing  May 18. That i s a  tuerminus date,m  but memory  serves  that  hte Commission  stays  on  the d eadlines for  SRO filigns like this.

 if your elooking back atthis from sme time in  the future, here is the relevant discussion: [GitHub](https://github.com/WhyDRS/SEC-Comments/discussions/14)

 This presently  has  been implmented in months an monthsof work [herre](https://github.com/WhyDRS/SEC-Comments/tree/31ded54461797c23bef39d5fb218c23f7047d546/TAR-S7-27-15). For the remainder o f this analysis,  I  will  write based o n memory rather than explicit r references  ot  existing  wor or  the porposed/concept/amending-release rules.

 ### B ackgorund of  two  options

Ignoring the easy answer of a simple html comment referncing upconming work in TAR.


 ####  OCC Adoptiopn

They  are amending  hte master  repurchase agemment  placed in 20022  as  the  setup for  hte repo agreements  of  underlying positional collateral. gernally, this i part  of  the ongooing ply  to overmargin  everyone  iwth cross-CCP arragmenets which require a  systemic bailout, saving  pensioneers accordiig to whatCan.[^deference] After soem  mininmal outreach  tor the  select  few  apes really  invovled in the nuance here afaik, it looks like it'll be challenging  to  get everyone's timeframes together, which is relevant  because  the o cmment  period  here has very real manifcations.

I spent Friday affirming this position.

 #### TAR  Cponcept

Asks for general concepts of a future market sturcture wihtout consideration of risk implications. This is alos generally true for departing Commission Peirce's "We Can Get THis Right" speech.

[^deference]: I've been reviewing  WhatCans' work these cclast  couppe days and ,  as communicated  ot them privately,  cna't b elieve we havne't  collabroatged before. I'd really t like to justr have htem help out dierectly  with the ocmment on  Github.  Let mme try giving them a call .[^resp]

[^resp]: Nothing  there  yet. I understand  that theyt  have other  work (?) and so prertty  reasonable, as is with  all the i n redible ocmmunity members.  I  really  appreciate t he krecent  help  from Cats and  Bob,  which i  would  never h ave uncovered withtou the sustainability  support  form  CHives.  ðŸ’œ  Others might n ot see it as much, but I deeply  appreciatee hte  gesture and read  voumes from it  as a market allocation  incentive of  outstanding percents.


## Pros  (stay oon S7-27-15)

- It's a really really important file number which I would personally just feel so much better commenting on in the future
- It owuld fill my heart wiht oy and happiness as satiation fills my body.
- I've been working on it under the scope here for over a year, albeit without deference to the original questions, whichhave stayed as open GithUb issues.
- Wouldn't need to mess around with James' issue tracker project because this is techincally a completely different file number if swapping.
- Wold be honestl in the sense that I would follow-thorugh oin what I've been promising people
- hur dur it's faster
- it's easier (again)
- I dont; have to deal with actually saving everyone form the impending shitstorm, and I can just say. i was right and now listen to my great safe scheme

## Cons  (swap to OCC-801)

- AN filing must consider bigger things than a normal rule change, such as the entire market's strucutre
  - 805(b) of DOdd-Frank would let me directly bullet-point:
    - robust risk management
    - safety and soundness
    - financial stability
    - systemic risk
- Even htough I went to comment on S7-27-15, I alwyas knew ewriting TAR1 that it would not answer the 400 specific quiestions which I have imemense insight into given my experinece at the Sydnicate. Their exisitng questions are excellent starting prompts which could gie me exeptional room to tell innovtion stories inspiring change. As it stands now, I'll need to do a second comment on the same rule number without the presuppositon of them taking it seriously enought to start whole new rule changing process. 
  - That last part is not likely under Atkins - pleain and simple, esp. given links to Securrency
  - If they follow a less involved refresh of comment periods, any following letter would still require the same rule number in the reply, which gets me to the double-commenting quotation propblem I originally planned to avoid with the "TAR2" coming from the Syndicate. But this is honestly quite duplicative and could weaken the "countjioned stelar operantus" methodiology and ethos.
- Passive-aggressive, indirect, and lamentable. It would read much more like a personal anectdote wihout addressing literally 96% of the raised questions directly. That's a strategy I've attempted through the past off-topic business footnotes, which failed spctaculrarly. This owuld give me the chance to grab the larget item I'm dealing with (_Great Taking_) and drag it aorund by the balls while forecasting the collapse they've planned.
  - Option A: we save investors and push their shit back another year (damn did the original OCC work save us _months_?!)
 - Option B: forced through, systemic collapse, and then a much stronger base to write from in TAR2
- I have been personally pushign this off for so so long because I wanted and needed to get it right. Those have always been the words, and this just seems like the perfect third stair to raise up the gilloutine.
- These MFs would walk out of a complete change with _everything_. All the assets, all the politicans, ad all the control. They could rug humanity just like they did in the '29 credit crunch and fuck it all up for everyone for decades to squander other nations.

## Call
Let's fuck their shit up, stir it around hot, and pour their asses on the concrete via OCC-2025-801.
