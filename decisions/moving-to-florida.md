So basically I'm at this point where I need to decide how much I trust myself. How much I believe in my own ability and intuition to do what's right. It's really scary.

I started to realize how meaningful this is when I was writing the DEX docs for Stellar. I am at the point where I weave in the free-market sentiments. Important!

This culminates a lot of work back in [1558](https://wooten.link/1558), which started me down the TAR work. It was a good practice run for the immense politicking and decision-making I needed in the Review. That took a lot, and I was not fulfilled at home during it.

I thought Kayla added everything I was missing from my mission. A perfect second half to fill my complementary skill sets. But I realize now that I need something much more.

It's not right to keep on with this when the love is gone, vanishing with trust. I just couldn't have faith in the stability, and I know that matters so very much in crisis.

The whole thing is going to come down, and nobody even sees it. It's all going to hit a wall harder than anything we've ever seen. And I need the absolute best home team when it does.

### Other factors

This challenges literally an insane amount. It's a super different path which has comparatively much less supporting evidence. But it feels right.

That's what I'm most scared of. What if I'm doing something that seems wrong but feels right? Because of course I don't want to leave this behind.

It's a slippery slope to centralization, akin to power. I have such heightened responsibilities and voice now, and I just want to do right!!!

There's more emotion charged in this than anything I've ever had to choose before. It is not my strong suit. I just want to UwU :) xc i;i =p

I've already cried a lot over this starting in August. It really hit me in July, and obviously led to the blog for RD. I never felt that need before.

She's helped me develop this deadly political skill. I feel like I should have the bandwidth to continue making it work. But it's draining.
