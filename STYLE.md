## Personal Style Preferences

This is mostly for myself, in case I foget things lol

### Main Phrases

- Most advanced, developed, and liquid capital market
- Liquidity is not a feature of Stellar. It is Stellar.

### Style Choices

- "Insolvent CCPs" superstructure rather than scoped "insolved CSDs"[^csd-diction]


[^csd-diction]: Conundrum is the centralization of clearing risk, not just custody
