The matter at  hand here  is wherther  or not to  correct  a DRS  community  post  on  the  [Dole case](https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=252690#page=12).  A smidge of accidental misinfgormation has worked its ay into  a  varieyt to content,  information which  I honestly  didn't even  notice at  first  since it's  a relatively  small part  of  the  compete  work.  Notwistadnign,m  it's  a material difference if  you  read  it out  fully.,

IN sessence,  the  ruling  paid DRS investors in full, which wa a  very  small percent  of the overall share claims. THe remainder Cede  investors  had to  split the rest  of the settlement ,  such  that they  owould  onyl  in therory have  75%  of  the  award per share submitter  per overallowance to DTC.  However,  in the  contnemt,  the 
 settlemnt  amount  was m istakenly  compared  to  the initial  buyout price,  citing  a  5X difference instead.

 ##  Pros (Correct it)

-  Keeps  communtiy  contnet ffavctually accurate
- Is honet



 ##  Cons  (;llet it  stay  wrong)


-  it  lookss a whole lot worse for Cedde investors  this way,  and  thus  could influence people  to further DRS.  


##  Call

Once i realized  honestly  was  on  the  line, i  just  brought  it up  quietaly  to  someone who  didn't make  the  graphic.  I did  so  in  a public forum that  the original  creator  doesn't  have access  to . THey are  an awesome person  trying  super hard  to  further  the ccause.

I'm all for letting  the  raw  work shine  through  as submitted,  but I j ust  cna't endorse allowing  a  material inacruancy  to  stay unccorrected  given  it's  a  perice of shared  work  which  I support.  therwise, I'm normally  fine letting epople think  what  they want to think.
