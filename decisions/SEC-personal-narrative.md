## Background

I've useda lot of stories in the pst throughout my comments . And  I will contiue to use my expriences to shape regualtory viewpoints. I onl find it prudent to fully contextualize my thoughts with formative background.

Today i was reminded of Matthew's dedicated trasnformation shortly after meeting Kayla. I remember visitng him for one oft he last itmes ast an on-campus church house party. After everthing, he just walked away from the promising career and future of sone cdreams for god.

Just before winter break in 2020, we went to a rooftop bar called Six Feet Under. Ocne we ate, we walked across the street through the cemetary a little (it was very big). I remmebr finding it on the fun food tour with Kayla through the area jst a litte bit later.

It was one of the last times I was paictured with that trading necklace, Those mmoent sof phsycial accessory change have ment so much to me as I repeatedl shed away past forms of self. I'm notw facing the tall challenge of how much to feature that personality in regulatory submissions.

## Materiality

I remember growing up, wanting to play music. And more than the trombone I was waltzed into by circumstance and peers. We had that awesome old Yamaha keyboard from the basement, and I desiged my whoel room aorun it.

the crown joy was getting ABleton and the PUsh. I remmber getting the middle-school admin to sign a document affirmign my enrollment as a student so that I could get the software discount. I was so into it for so long before I really found markets through Tea Fortnress an later day tading.

The turnaround was relatively qiuck; only acouple years at most seriously playing around wht the osunds. But it was exceptioanlly freeing, ike I had the conmplete power to create my own art manifesting everything I knewand loed. While trading had that to an extend in the limited context of asset vanue, it always had strict rules mandating disciplined compliance.

Now, for really the first time, I've had the freedom n the bounds of ocmmunity disucssions with others who get the problem, and it's been just a plbalst scoping out the market I want to create. I took such a big leap singling out the DTCC very early on, and all those accusations proved exactly right. I want to trust in myself and create this whole new indsutryst.

## Situation

In drafting the finalresponse to thefirst Syndicat eExaindation, I need to decide whther or not to deeply implicate my own persona .

One other item includes a sidebar on personal frugaility nade professional objective

### Pros (include narrative image)

- Perosnal touch making for convincinf imediate arguments

### Cons

- Grealty increase risk of centralizing aroudn my own throughts
  - I could become a focus of ongoing developments rather than the actions and legislations themselves
