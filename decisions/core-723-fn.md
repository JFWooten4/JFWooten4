# Comprehensive SDEX docs given material `TAR` time contraints

Need to decide whether or not to [fully-implement](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/issues/763) my [docs update](https://github.com/users/JFWooten4/projects/1?pane=issue&itemId=76508798) with individual SDEX sections detailing the different liquidity venues at this point in time.

## Pros

Better documentation and contextualization for the entire network around liqudiity.

Seems there is a growing indifference as to whether native or Soroban AMMs succeed, which present s extremely material best-execution risks.

There's a lot to dive into there, but effectively there's a serious chacnce that people might overlook/forget all the work that went into bringing AMMs to sStellar native.

This is anextremely major feat unmathced throughout the industry in any other meaningfully-decentralized way&mdash;working extensively on this specific documentation could highlight that reality.

Easier to refernece specific things in the comment from individualized pages. 

Gives a spot for the liquidity backstory info moved into the starting raft for the 1558 discussion, as committed.

## Cons

Will probably take an extra couple weeks.

Already been so much work advocating for efficiency across the community, it could take futher buy-in from the core team who are actually legitimately busy and not as experienced in _markets._

God I wish Jon would reply to outreach because I feel like that;s the one perfpesective that would make this a super easy call. But alas.

**This would fragment the footnote _Id._-ing and such across fdifferent points, which materially weekens precedential reference to the initial declaration.**

This would also mean I'd be less able to cite _supra_ at Sec / paragraph XYZ via aituhtoritative symols.

## Other

However just as an aside L29 will have a quite limited affect on the long-term implications when referenced since the sections will change, and I can't make regulators read a git permalink.

The SDEX is comprehensively documented as it stands today. Like you can look at the existing liqudity page and it will give you the info you need to strart divings into the network docs things. And there are a very large number of independent sites that are note the Stellar community docs which have gone into the nitty-gritty as to how the ops woprk.

# Call

Simplified execution as single sub-page.
