really good option here if / I guess when we have the foundation fund from the community side if it goes to the community side is that we can do a repost of tomeres question to I think James or alpha about why the routing isn't acceptable 

I don't know what the semantics should be for the text but it should link to a video on the YDRF page that is pretty slick ass animation for something along the lines of "Why alternative trading venues are unacceptable" ish

fine you can phrase it as a question you pussy bitch
