##  jed  language  circa  passive offers

"A passive offer is an offer that does not take a counteroffer of equal price. It will only fill if the prices are not equal. For example, if the best offer to buy BTC for XLM has a price of 100XLM/BTC, and you make a passive offer to sell BTC at 100XLM/BTC, your passive offer *does not* take that existing offer. If you instead make a passive offer to sell BTC at 99XLM/BTC it would cross the existing offer and fill at 100XLM/BTC."
