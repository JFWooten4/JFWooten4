I think the CMC altogether.

And then Diamond Tiara.

I see a lot of myself in them both. For DT we have a directive basis. And for the CMC we have an odyssey and then acceptance of stability with continuity.

The change in their coordination mechanisms really hit, and it being from the CMC's influence just mirrors so much how everything must change for me.

This episode and song just really helped me to realize something was wrong, and I will always appreciate that.

### Silver Spoon

I don't know—there is some universe where Silver Spoon is her, but I really think the larger message comes to irreversible transformation, including role identity with the CMC.

In another interpretation, she is the Commission. With ignoring the 'drama' of political DEX points to follow the letter. It would make more sense as the same gender.
