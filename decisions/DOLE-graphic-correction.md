The matter at hand here is whether or not to correct a DRS community post on the [Dole case](https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=252690#page=12). A smidge of accidental misinformation has worked its way into a variety of content, information which I honestly didn't even notice at first since it's a relatively small part of the complete work. Notwithstanding, it's a material difference if you read it out fully.

In essence, the ruling paid DRS investors in full, which was a very small percent of the overall share claims. The remainder Cede investors had to split the rest of the settlement, such that they would only in theory have 75% of the award per share submitted per overallowance to DTC. However, in the content, the settlement amount was mistakenly compared to the initial buyout price, citing a 5X difference instead.

## Pros (Correct it)

- Keeps community content factually accurate  
- Is honest

## Cons (Let it stay wrong)

- It looks a whole lot worse for Cede investors this way, and thus could influence people to further DRS.

## Call

Once I realized honesty was on the line, I just brought it up quietly to someone who didn't make the graphic. I did so in a public forum that the original creator doesn't have access to. They are an awesome person trying super hard to further the cause.

I'm all for letting the raw work shine through as submitted, but I just can't endorse allowing a material inaccuracy to stay uncorrected given it's a piece of shared work which I support. Otherwise, I'm normally fine letting people think what they want to think.
