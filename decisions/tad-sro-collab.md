# Syndicate Policy Construction Standards

I need to decide whether or not to make TAD3 an inter-agent standard or not.

What does it mean to control someon? Would you all the law of the land control, given itts explicit-_ish_ scope of peanaltiess? Or perhaps you;d think of the monetary system as a control mechanism?

A fear of imprisonment or worse certainly instills due fear in most people to halt physcial crime. But what about the fraud so commonplace in midncial intermediaries? Do we call this _idem_ crime, or is it a more nuanced form of behaviour much more challenging to assert?

In contemplating the Ad rules, it's become abundantly clear the relatinoship of trust to historically stewarded by our elected represtatives, a relationship which has geometically deteriorated over the decades. Unfortunately, these oversight processes do not seem adept to today's growing market complexity. Given much of my abitions circle around entering billions into capital markets, I must contemplate what could be the best option for a next generation not incumbered (or otherwise _civis protectus_) by a select few three-letter agencies.

Indeed, these established insitutions prefrent ingrained in our market plumbing fail to adequantly protect investors abroad, and vice versa for foreign governments and their own instituted inefficiencies.[^xml] Might the cost of these often corrupted paths outweigh the historic niccities they;ve instilled in markets past? I just don't think a centralized solution will best serve us all.


[^xml]: _See, e.g,_ rule that all Birtish merger proxis must be sent as full package through post to all investors. Policies like these are demonstratovely reuinous for our environment, for no reason in modern ontexts. Might we establish a better way that works for these billions of new people?

## Call



[^code]: Albeit the code repos and such probably shouldn't move, and all that is fine how it stands for security concerns.
