6days, thanks for stating on the details of an important topic Mark's been exploring for a long time. I'm the founder of the referenced company and spend a lot of my time in the community. I appreciate what Byrne did for the industry, and it sounds like my goals align with Alan in certain regards.

Our technology employs decentralized exchange, and there's a big difference of form in that defi vs. an ATS. I'll just refer to that exchange business under the umbrella of the entire broker including the correspondent custodian with crypto. I'd expect you understand the differences in depth, but we spell it out for public transparency.

I agree that the goal is compliance, but for me it's also protecting the public beyond certain limited NMS rules. I've talked to a lot of broker executives, and the matter of brokering always comes down to business model. This shouldn't surprise anyone, as tZERO pays its shareholders with the 1% trading fee.

Can you decentralize custody (because that's what DRS is) while maintaining centralized exchange venue, routing, and corporate control?



I've always concluded broker access through nominee name cannot align with collaborative investor-first markets.

Here's a huge difference of form in these central exchanges with defi systems.

They present two execution locations which are strictly mutually exclusive.


There are some deeper issues that I thiuj lead into rge "4 step model " conversation, because @the_DTCC doesn't just throw 140 people into a conference call for no reason.
