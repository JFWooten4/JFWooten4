Upon further review, it looks like I just forgot their name (see next final seconds of [clip](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxapR6gRwz8DXsp_sm1tSkKwAXijolKcbK). This dives deeply into incetivizing permissionless labor imo since that's what most research is. You just pick something to investigate of your own volition and do it.

Segway into third lemmy post







"Stellar is a financial protocol that essentially increases the interoperability between diverse financial systems and diverse currencies. It allows any kind of currency or any kind of value—dollars, euros, bitcoin, pesos—to move freely within the network. It also allows for any kind of transaction size: from large business-to-business payments down to micro micro-transactions. It is intended to be a backend for realtime and faster payments, and it also is a backend for lower foreign-exchange-type of transactions—cross-border transactions. It is supported by a not-for-profit: the Stellar Development Foundation, which Jed and I are a part of. It is structured that way so it can behave more like the internet (and more like email/SMTP)… different kinds of core infrastructure that are not owned by one entity.”
