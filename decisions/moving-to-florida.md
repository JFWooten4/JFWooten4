SO basically I'm at thi point where I Need to decide how much I trust myself. Howmm uhc I belive in my onw abiliy and intuition to do what's right/ ti's really scary.

I started to eealize how menainguf lthis is when I was wiritning the DEX doca for Stellar. I am at the point hwere I weave in the free-market sentiments. Important!

This culminates a lot of work back in [1558](https://wooten.link/1558), which started me down the TAR work. it was a good practice frun for hte immense politcking and decision-makign i needed in the Review. That took a lot, and I was not fulfilled at home during it. 

i thought kayla added everything i was missing form my mission. a perfect secondh half to fill my complimentary skillssets. but i realize now that I need soemthing much more.

it's onot right to keep on with this when the love is gone, vanishing with trust. i just couldnt have fairth in the stability. and i know that matters so very much in crisis.

The whole thing is going to come down, and nobody even sees it. It's all going to hit a wall harder than anyhting we've ever seen. And I need the absolute best home team when it does.

### other factors

This chalgnes literally an insnae amount. It's a super differnet pat h which has comparatively much less supporting evidence. But it feels wright.

That's what I'm msot scared of. What if I'm doing somethat that seems wrong but feels right? Becuase of course I don't wnat to leave this behind.

It's a slipperly slope to centralization, akin to power. I have such hightened responsabilities and voice now, and ... I jus want to do righ!!!

There's more emotion charged in this than anythign I've hever had to choose before. It is not my strong suit. I just want to UwU :) xc i;i =p

I've already cried a lot over this starting in August. It really hit me in July, and obv. led to blog for RD. I never felt that need before.

she;s helped me develop this deadly politcal skill. I feel like I should have the bandwidth to continue making it work. But it's draining.
