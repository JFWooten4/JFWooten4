This is something I feel very strongly needs to be done. So yeah. I just think it’s valuable to walk through this mentally here for records. It's the sort of thing I don't get to experience a lot in life.

The matter in full context is that she and I had a joint account where we'd put our income. While I've transitioned everything back to my own individual account at another bank, she continues using all of it. Just the last few days after a paycheck, she deposited another $500 into the funds, which she doesn't.

## Pros

- Could keep getting extra money
  - Partially offsets all the expenses I covered over the years
- Helps me think clearly about next steps without overwhelming fiscal entanglements
- Puts us both back on the track for independence
- Forces me to make work pay for living costs
  - It's been a crutch supporting nonmarket work
  - I'll need to stop presuming and start affirming value
  - Same position as most contributors, in that they need sustaining income, so I can feel alignment easier
- Still a family safety net as needed (no, I will not do that government shit)
- Removes lingering emotional context of financial transactions, which is the reason I closed the fund down in the first place

## Cons

- Feels bad
  - IDK exactly how, but this odyssey has given me the ability to make feeling choices, which is sorta femme
- Not truthful
  - Once she presumably changes the power account on her own after this last autorun, there won't be any shared expenses from here
- Will make her pretty sad likely, since this is an affirming step of our separation
- I will need to be very careful that this leaves me on the right track, continuing to stay on values over money
- Removes that feeling of happiness and validation when we worked together towards a shared financial future

## Call

Empty and close it like I said.

### Edit

This was the correct call. I nearly had o panic attack which coalesced into a junk binge last night just taking care to remove the last extra interest from last month. I think it's the combination of interacting with banks plus the complex emotional ramifications (in normal forum, which is just the same too much to handle from the fund[^c])

[^c]: Chives' humorous solution to this challenge was to just not give a shit about the people whose money you manage. I think it's hilarious because that's effectively what happens when you charge a management fee on a down year. Any partner fiscal entanglements unfortunately seem to trigger this same mental need to perfect returns despite internal costs.
