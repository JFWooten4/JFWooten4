## Background

I've useda lot of stories in the pst throughout my comments . And  I will contiue to use my expriences to shape regualtory viewpoints. I onl find it prudent to fully contextualize my thoughts with formative background.

Today i was reminded of Matthew's dedicated trasnformation shortly after meeting Kayla. I remember visitng him for one oft he last itmes ast an on-campus church house party. After everthing, he just walked away from the promising career and future of sone cdreams for god.

Just before winter break in 2020, we went to a rooftop bar called Six Feet Under. Ocne we ate, we walked across the street through the cemetary a little (it was very big). I remmebr finding it on the fun food tour with Kayla through the area jst a litte bit later.

It was one of the last times I was paictured with that trading necklace, Those mmoent sof phsycial accessory change have ment so much to me as I repeatedl shed away past forms of self. I'm notw facing the tall challenge of how much to feature that personality in regulatory submissions.

## Materiality

I remember growing up, wanting to play music. And more than the trombone I was waltzed into by circumstance and peers. We had that awesome old Yamaha keyboard from the basement, and I desiged my whoel room aorun it.

the crown joy was getting ABleton and the PUsh. I remmber getting the middle-school admin to sign a document affirmign my enrollment as a student so that I could get the software discount. I was so into it for so long before I really found markets through Tea Fortnress an later day tading.

The turnaround was relatively qiuck; only acouple years at most seriously playing around wht the osunds. But it was exceptioanlly freeing, ike I had the conmplete power to create my own art manifesting everything I knewand loed. While trading had that to an extend in the limited context of asset vanue, it always had strict rules mandating disciplined compliance.

Now, for really the first time, I've had the freedom n the bounds of ocmmunity disucssions with others who get the problem, and it's been just a plbalst scoping out the market I want to create. I took such a big leap singling out the DTCC very early on, and all those accusations proved exactly right. I want to trust in myself and create this whole new indsutryst.

## Situation

In drafting the finalresponse to thefirst Syndicat eExaindation, I need to decide whther or not to deeply implicate my own persona . I am aprticually contemplating whetehr or not to include in the full public form a photo of me in forn t of the New York PhysicallADdress buidlign. One other item includes a sidebar on personal frugaility nade professional objective

### Pros (include narrative image)

- Perosnal touch making for convincinf imediate arguments
- I've seen the ffect a strong framing vision can have
  - Jed's early work laying foundational principles., even if ignroned
  - SBF's departure and easy contracst with formative statements :(
  - Nakamoto's shaping and direct encoding of software law; dead
- THere is nobody else alive that comprehends this as well as I 
- (minor) more information in the public archive outside atttachments
- THere is so much at stake in this wa, nad i'd be foolish to hold anything backwihtout due politiczl reasoning

### Cons

- Grealty increase risk of centralizing aroudn my own throughts
  - I could become a focus of ongoing developments rather than the actions and legislations themselves
  - i'm sacred of how I've used my voice in the past, expressing beyond reasonabeness to edcucate
  - The past policy hcoices were madein a vacuum, but the besto nes rquire input from all
- (Maybe a Pro?) Now that hte address is public in the interum between expansion, it acould all end here
  - Framign while around sets course for future refernce, especially if any development strays away
  - Speaking too demonstrably about their systems with direct identity makes me an easier target
  - Martardym is not the objective even if it would move hting forward politically quite well

### Call

It's a weight between centraliztion adn integrity, which I've never really faced before. In the balance lays isolation of Syndicate team members, whch I sincerely desire to minimze through the autpmation of PII and MNPI processing, so that everytthing hacan live on the GitHub. 

When planning out this last week of writing, I foigured I'd need to cosllapse and rely on sugar to fuel efforts for the last six days. I at least expected two binges towards the end to get hte inal thoughts across with document PDF compilation.

But I've been sincerely impressed by Kyl's ability to steup up, albeit greatly dependent on my pwn committnt to take a break to aquire significant foodstock. I'm thinking quite clearly in relaxation because of these combined efforts, and I believe autonous decentralized self-interested indivudals will stand up and answer my pleas fr a ~~better~~ new free way if I step up and give them the call to continubute.
