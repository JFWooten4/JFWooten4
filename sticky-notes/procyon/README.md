Challenges with not capitalism

- Think back when trying to convey 'social value' to Mom (for parental approval).

All I wanted to do was satisfy her to be proud and stuff.

Came home to announce 17k XVG spike gain -> crickets.

WSB 25k mean profit: "What is this, a portfolio for ants?" -> 17k KEMET gain ignored until expired worthless.

It is just impossible to organize people.

{Hmm, but that last part reads as something centrally coordinated.}
