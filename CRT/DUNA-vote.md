## Title

DUNA Ownership, Governance, and Stewardship of BlockTransfer


## Body

First and foremost, information regarding this proposal was presented orally at the [ Custody Conference](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1435315414333788302) today. To account for the delay in publishing this talk, I've set the maximum voting timeframe (to 30 days). 

In case it's not clear, I would like the Association to responsably steward the technology here because I'd like to instill permanent change into stocxs. -marknet infrastructure. That said, I don't think it's appropriate to personally vote on this agenda item. 

### Preface


Generally, I do not like using videos as (primary) sources for governance proposals. Doing so soems sloppy, takes vuch longer to skim, and can't be easily released on  subscription feeds. 

However,the contents of this proprsal have been in the works for two years,and feedback has deen good so far. Moreover, this is a nonbinding sentiment vote to greenlight implementation work. 


### Substance 

I propose to donate all or part of the shares in [BlockTrans Syndicate](https://www.issuers.info/1846058) by the end of the year. this can be done through a standard ownership transfer, encumberment, or assidgnment - based on an implementation I will subsequently propose 

BT is an SEC-regulated transfer agent,and our work last year cleared up that this can stay seperate from ownership oversight. i envision it acting as a market-utility business that contributes to our nonprofit mission. 


### Budget 

i do not feel comfortable asking the DUNA for funds allocatohd to this proposal. Once we have sentiment affirmed, it should be a relatively straightforward transfer process with the Syndicate acting as its own agent (as resolved last AGM).

If you would like to show your support monetarily,please consider donating (not tax-exempt) directly to one of my accounts. there is a law firm ive followed aver che years through my preliminary design explorations, but I don't think this is the best use of DUNA funds 



### Principles

There are some nuonces to word legally, mut broadly I would like the shares to stay in the Association forever. I believe we can facilitate issuer representative without a separate carveout outside this holding structure. 

This also helps keep tho shares out of the profit-driven market, locking them away without financial interest. Let's keep DRS in our control!
