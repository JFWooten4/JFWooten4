it  feels nice to be back in this repo dolder. These lastm onths have b een so many ccdecisions with PII or MNPI that make it impossible for me to draft in public. But liuckily I think msot of that is well bedhind me knnow and we ;l'lll have all teh publicaiton out.

 i;m at  a really tough crossroads (but where the road starts pslitting) between my DRS and XLM work. Or at least, it's a railroad siding that runs parallel for some distance before recocmnnecting. The core channlenge is the hsseer armount of pending work in the Defficiny  ltetter response.

I very seriously contemplated  attending a communtiy even some distancce away during the reiew peiod due on Sep 15. I won't pull punches or politckikc ty ou through how that decision was made. A happenstance of factors lead to a lotgistical inconvencinece whccih I took as a sign to abandon otureach.

THat said, I'm stil elft with material communtiy outreach on both siddes, and I'm having a really hcallenging qualm between prikoritizing me _very centralized work_ getting this frameworkk and factual efidence back  to the Commission. THe essence for me is **explaining v. accting** the reaility I'm describing to them. It's whetehr I should lean into decentralized work that brings the whole ecosysteem forward or  my own statutory obligations.

## Pros[^1]

[^1]: For  clarity,  the decision at stake  its whetehr to engage with Hunter in  the immeiate response period to their outreach, likely entailing a phone call. I still need to circel around with the government numbering office  to  get a solid reference for ยง 1/ ogff the reply. That alone could take up two days of social bandwidth.

- Already engaging in a community call on friday:
  - With Chives and WhatCan
  - framed around getting to the bottom off FAST reporting  discrepencies
  - not exactly someonthinee I am imediaelyt authoritatively needed to assists, but rather done for the explorative and political purposes of the Hunter  caht
- Deepen a greally great relatinoshiip where we're both amking bug strides to get netowrrk funding right
-  THey are really xmart, and  did I mention they are working on really  cool stuff despite huge challenges
-0 Inlay to Silence working itmes through Atlaas dev groupo, which has direct liinks to the FOundation
  - Not sure and almsot  a con in the latter part
  - Existing developmetns incomplete with Bri and inside team on docs
  - OUtsidfe of public forum and refreshes the tiimeclockk on backdated referfences for Dash
- Very strong [historical outrach](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/911254664576643122/1362183910309757120)

##  cons

- In the DRS example, I have a whoel new colaborator to gain 
  - Extrmeley similar overlap of existing wokr
  - Same itnerestes in investigation and reformm
  - Not really the case with Hunter, who I sponsor
- Crux of the item is my lacking frameworks for collective working item renumartion, and I sdislike requesting efforts with no evenue for compensation in anny of its forms
- COuld probably  happen later, albeit wiht less timely rgior
- Could deter existing narrativve which is at least 2 months bacmlklogged  by the SEC burndne
- Take material time awayh ffrom the response which jsut  gkeeps expanding in sccope
- Risks missing something timestampped whi ch could be a backlinek in TAR2
- The  historical outreeach extends  NQWG  and SCF work rather  than  the nimmediated needed SEC reploy
  - TO  the  textnet relative,  this is proabbly  the m ost sccruitinty _I_ will have  as the indepddnent coordinator of all the SYdnicate efforts
  - Getting it right therfore with the same prudence as past judicial arguments made in condensed timeframes would set  an exceptikonal precedent
  - As a counter, I don't klnwo how often we;'ll see Steve oncce we mocve to INdiaina oversight sector, but I believe they would still cross-ref


##  CAll

This is really hard because veery insstinct in my heart satys  to perform the communiy ourtreach and continue growing together.  I just absoluite hate how these centralized ddeadlines arbitrarirly forcem into biunnds.[^2] Yuo know, the Commission has been quite satisfied with plan layouts and publidc references, so  Isay let's squeeze it in and say hi  to the start of technical delegatioj.

[^2]: And it;s not tlike they fdon't help get things across the finish line. _See, e.g.,_ the epxedidted TAR1  comment termination, which  itself  cut o ff in the genesis  material DEX documentation work still outstanding. But it's a matterr  of form that's more intimately violated, takign the locust  of control away from creative  collabotrotr liberties.
