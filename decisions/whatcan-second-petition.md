I'm dealing with what could be my most centralized decisions yet. For setup context, we have still not received a response from the Commission in re Exam 1 findings after interim review meeting prior to final call. This is a great thing which was highly praised in https://github.com/JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/blob/main/2025/Jul/30.md[^1]

[^1]: This perfectly exemplifies the root of the matter, which is that I've become too central to the regulatory interactions and broader policy discourse. It needs to center around Syndivate public policies and collective operating principles rather than my view.

The essence of the quandary stems around how quickly I want to tie the interweaving knot between all these established relationships. I'm going to take my time given an impending circumstance, because I've known about them and prepared deeply for so long.


## Context

I've started feeling this way since I went down the coffee route to get the last pending items out in accordance with centralized deadlines. There was one Saturday post-submission where I was practically shaking the whole day, constantly intaking calories to even moderately satiate my energy needs to think.

I'm going to try changing sleep schedules to get myself back into a more comfortable place, but for the immediate moment, I have a very short window to choose and act on this time. It revolves entirely around the last week of prep we've done in getting WhatCan's principled thoughts into a stellar [petition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1mhdxrs/petition_to_close_regsho_loopholes_allowing).


### Options

I could not send the letter, leaving staff completely uninterrupted in their oversight process. Presumably this would mean also not reaching out prematurely to Donna to speak on overarching items and regulatory sentiments.

I'm trying deeply to figure out how to remove myself from this equation and let community collaboration flourish.


### Interum Call

I'm goign to Give Donna a call later today and get a little more context o nteh positioning after discussion with other Exmaniner that;'s worked with "blpockcahin"  TA . I like callign  "low-level" stafg most akin to direct engineers because we have an actuall legitimate working relationshup together.  I don't  equaate it to ploticking becise I alreaey know them and we;ve conversed before/.


### NonRepsosive Feedbacck

UNforutnalye  (and forutnatley), I didn't hear form Donna and  still on the cold waiting phase until our last  meeting to go over the Exam resutls . I' mglad for the expanded scope and comprehensivve reviewe, not to m ention some  time to get  stick ynotes from phsycial nto nottkaing form. This  leaves me  in my standard frame for all these years: interpetting.

One reading with sufficient evidence-based backing cnaa  take hte cake. I'm  very p lleased with how Exmainations arei n  themselves a  staff reading  of hte  hard framework laws.   Thus  I find myself here at the drawing  baord in solace, a common comfortin g zone


## Factors

### Pros (drafting cover and sending)

-  Embed a personal narrative
  - Connect  to existing work
  - Add date for refrences
  - Backlink  to PREV
- Add color to  the swatch of strikeouts
- Adds to overall petitioner  support and sujustidicaitkon
- add diversity to communtiyh perspectves with strong basis
-  Chnace to throw a timestamp on the FAC poitns not known
- bacik an established, passionate voice doing much good


### Cons (submitting only WC template from john@whydrs email)

- IMp[oses my own credit onto WC's work-product (can be minimized by only signing last  page or  staying anonymous)
- Somewhat shows distrust i n standalone perfomrance
-  Na e and imaging irrevocably associatged whith WhyDRS
  - Good thing long term but a big jum pfro staff here at  start
  - Ca  establish links at cost  of a hastey judgment turnaround
  - Begins challenging work of disentangling and removeing conflicts
- Narrative changes risk alientating original draft sentiments
- Cwentralazized in the senes of pusahign a direct narrative over and aboe thoughtful profdding thoiugh sdiscarded qeustions.


## Logic

I  really hate politickign; I'm just  so  sick of  it./ It's an insane  amoutn of mental bandwidfth, and so itoftne it's literally for  naut.  I am happy that I sepent  so  mcuh time nad effort  getting my first impressions correct with t he  five femeniene orgnaizations which matter in my life. But like bruh sincerelyt I could not given another single flying  fuckl aboutj how people vciew my  work.,

## Call

lol let's do it.
the worst  case here  is not even a frinking caser at all
