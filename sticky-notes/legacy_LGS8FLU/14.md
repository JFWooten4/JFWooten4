There are [so many problems](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-occ-2024-001/srocc2024001-typeh.htm) in our markets, and I can't think of any other community better suited to tack them. ü§≥ In the coming week, in as much time as I can find while [packing up to move](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-trader-trailblazer-web3-stock-investments-sec-review-john-wooten-zvxbc/), I'll be working on a detailed comment letter per [recent news](https://lemmy.whynotdrs.org/post/1410399). üëà

Given the [monopolization of securities trading and settlement](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=law_and_economics_wp), I believe we can convince regulators to extending FOIA access to non-governmental entities, just as they did with FTD data in the 2000s. üë®‚Äçüíª These systemically important financial institutions have virtually no threat of competition given the impossibility of replacing their systems with anything outside of blockchain, which obviates the need for any such middlemen entirely. Given that this is the main reason requests have historically been denied for financial SROs, the unbelievable lack of transparency in [this rule](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/occ/2024/34-99393-ex3.pdf) might just be the straw that breaks the camel's back given the risk of options clearing amidst high volatility. üí•

Such public information would undoubtedly promote global liquidity, investment, prosperity. üíπ Clearing corporations maintain monopoly control in the CSD regime and should not be subject to anticompetitive information opaqueness protections, especially given FTX in S7-15-23 and CZ. See SCI protections and consider extensions under prongs therunder with specific locations.

Theodore Roosevelt:
"I feel that we shall ultimately have to consider the adoption of some such scheme
as that of a progressive tax on all fortunes, beyond a certain amount, either given in life or
devised or bequeathed upon death to any individual-a tax so framed as to put it out of the
power of the owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount
to any one individual."
