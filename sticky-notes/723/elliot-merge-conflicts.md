  [fn]([^unless-regulated]: If you are issuing regulated assets, make sure to assign `low` signature threshold keys before removing access to `high` threshold master keypair. If you do intend to limit an asset's supply, then the `low` threshold signers should not be able to combine up to a `medium` threshold, which could issue new tokens. Relevantly, assuming `high` > `medium` weight for issuer account thresholds, you will not be able to change the `low` threshold signers after locking.) and [pg](It is possible to lock down the issuer account of an asset so that the assetâ€™s supply cannot increase. To do this, first set the issuer accountâ€™s master weight to 0 using the Set Options operation.[^unless-regulated] This prevents the issuer account from being able to sign transactions and therefore, making the issuer unable to issue any more assets. Be sure to do this only after youâ€™ve issued all desired assets to the distributor account. If the asset has a Stellar Asset Contract, also make sure the admin for the contract was not updated from the default (which is the issuer) using the `set_admin` contract call. If the admin was not the issuer, then the admin would be able to mint the asset even with the issuer account locked.)
