okay so we've  got  a p retty privotal  decision here. The mmatter  at hand is whetehr or not to redirect he existing  TAR1  comment  to the oCC's 802 rule  closing  May 18. That i s a  tuerminus date,m  but memory  serves  that  hte Commission  stays  on  the d eadlines for  SRO filigns like this.

 if your elooking back atthis from sme time in  the future, here is the relevant discussion: [GitHub](https://github.com/WhyDRS/SEC-Comments/discussions/14)

[^resp]: Nothing  there  yet. I understand  that theyt  have other  work (?) and so prertty  reasonable, as is with  all the i n redible ocmmunity members.  I  really  appreciate t he krecent  help  from Cats and  Bob,  which i  would  never h ave uncovered withtou the sustainability  support  form  CHives.  ðŸ’œ  Others might n ot see it as much, but I deeply  appreciatee hte  gesture and read  voumes from it  as a market allocation  incentive of  outstanding percents.
