practiclly none  of htis was made by me. I have no rights  to the art. THe addition commit tries it s best to tattirubte the original sourc.e

I'm inspired ot cterat this because :

- i've lost art  soruces i n  [past work](https://youtu.be/Myumx8wLo6Y),
-  I bleieve my local dekstop envioment reflects material internat idde,[^a] and
- I'dd like top disclose the present state of  my  syche, as  [attempted](https://github.com/JFWooten4/dreams).

IF  you're an artist, please  don't  hate me for posting here!  ðŸ’œ Genrally I do not like duplicating past m ental states  with  the smae backgrounds,  sicnce i nnovation  requires  constant reinvention. ðŸ§   I  hope  everyone  [iscovereds](https://wooten.link/lead) uniquye  inspiratinos, art, and ethos ðŸš€


[^a]: for instnacm,e i  jusit had it as the [mission](../banners/mission.png) fir the longnest time. While  that's  my distilled p ublic-facing  goal and an introduction  ot my ideals, it is sorta boring lol.  ANd  htat's perfectly  fine,  since financial markets are supposed to be boring (_see_ BT logo ccolors)!
