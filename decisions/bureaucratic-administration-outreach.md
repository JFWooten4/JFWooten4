F9irst o f  alsl, some  sick as\s  trades laltlerly   in the real  financial  markets.  SO  fdujc kling  pissed it';s taking twso weeks  to m ove m oney around after iniitiating trasnfers  early t his m onth.  Fuck you  banks and fuck  you Wall St.

Probabyl  shouldn't  be inluding that kind of context  in  a  decision liek this, but man  this i s  a pretty  material one. It  incoprrates as lot of  experience over a diverse six years of navirgating beiorocuracies. it  reminds me of the [lettedr]](../static/srcs/trimbath-stanford-letter.pdf)  I wrtoe to Trimbath  some  time back.

#  Context

I've found  that there's two kinds o f  engineers. the first receive a paycheck  from a  central orgnaization defintatively  not  of thier  design.[^a] The  others find somethign  theyh  wwant  rto work on and then they just do it.

it's a deep=rooted personal perfspective which I generally see stems from  early educational experiences. And  this isn't  to  say  that it's a permanant  classification. BUt it  is a  present identification flag  which someone needs  to  change or maintain on their own.[^b]

I  find  that this perspective  works iits way into responses to public feedback, or genrally suggestions. With the exception onf job mandates from  "above"  to  consider viewpoints, the former  group can often incidentally  ignore market feedback.[^c]  Conversely, thee latter generally  consider, reply, anmd listen  to market feedback.

## Journey

It's a  long path from the central norms of yesteryear to the indepepdnendt decentralization availed  by modern blocchain technology. One form which comes to mind is  that  Trimbath letter, sent using  outdated snail mail. The address was invalid, and so she didn't even receive the post. 

Sometimes  it  feels lik this with central organizations, even  if  a mesage gets delivered. Something that  comes to mind: the Bernie MAdoff whisteblower who never  won  because his tip was  tragically forwarded  to  the New Jerseyt investigation o ffice rather  than  New York.   The  rquiavalnt Ive seen is reaching out to  smoeone in the org who just doesn't directly relate.

They dfont relate  to what you're putting  down,  they don't  understyand  where you're comign  from,  and  they  might not even  care about the underlying  ethos you're pushing across. And, from the outside lookign in, someone's  interests  can  be extrememly  challenging to gauge based on public progiles, job  titles, and  perhaps department.s This  leaves  most  outreach in  the form of spamming "heads" pof deperatmeejts or the C-suite, since  they're hte only p eopple who you can rely on to  care about larger itemms.

##  Materials

Dare i say most outreach should  be  for larger  items. There aare customer support channels  or  search engines for the smaller things. Even with  the TA outreach  about TAD3,  it was  so cleear  that  the de-minimu daily job emplyoees ust  couldn't care less aotu more systemic changes.

I really  don;t liek needing  centralized support channels. It  always  feles like I'm just a  number waiting  in line for rsome crappy government services. But  this seems like the most  common way to provide help through a central meansd.[^d]

Comparatively,  I've  found extremely sasitfying  support through  the communtiy  help  outreach c hannels  in  Stellar  and  even  some interplaced  DRS chats  over the years. THere are active latter-type egineers who  actually want t o grow  the community and  teach  others, ready t o answer questions  on a moment's notice.  and overr  time you actally  uild relationshps with these people,. collaborating towards shared ovbejctives through productive  exchanges.

##  Teamxzs

Thuis we wget  to team  formation, somethign which remind me of being picked last in gym  growing up. The  central version of creating pteamss  is really  inneficient. You put  out htese  "requirements"  where far  too  many peeople submit general "good-lookign"  peirces of paper summarizing  thier carreer.

Now  you have to  extensively  discuss  their background,  spend lkiteral days of your week conversing abotu  them, and maybe even  involve dreaded _committees_.  it''s s omucch work  that ti takees up a "whole department.' Much fo the  challnge for me comes  form needing  to  rmemebr  all this crap about tall these poeopel.

IOt's inadquard to form forced relationshisp with  coworkers solely  becuase of your subject assisgments.  TGHe smae is true for  slaes, where  often whole softare proeducts exist to track the  persxonal  infoormation "needed' to  close  a deal for a wide range of prospect.s These are really  unnatural ways to squezed together  relationshiups which coiuld form naturally thoguth shared interest and open publications.

# Choice(s)

The first thing  after Johan on my calendar/todo-list (close, phyuscial) right now is to ""politic  cCOmmissioner Pierce from  Vegas," extending a prior bump-together from years abck where a blockchain  TA was introduced b ut not mnaterially discussed. For all intensive purposes, it's a cold outreach very similar to my  present interactions with Jusin, COO  SDF/. We've had like thr ee  interactions since eatlry  this year after quite briefly meeting last  COnsensus.

Mucch  of  ths relction  stems  form  thje recnet commuinity  evolution  of  Emir  into emplyment  staff  at hte  SCF.  We'ver  had extensive p rivate  discussions influenced by t he last-2024 interleaving discussions which  benefitted  his prior edmployer. THe  vast  difference in tone with those cchats  work me  up to the  easty  with  which I  cna communicate with the DRS communtiy, a  stark differnce I've noticed  for years now given  a mislagnment  of values compared to certain Stellar-Global sentiemnts.

I really  appreciate the  rfreedom  I  get  to  expresso n  a  daily  basis through myh  work,  a  feeling which  I  see startykly  thrown down  in  EMir's public  ommuntiy -suprot work.  At least  fomr pmy perosnal  view,  Apes ahve  these incredible  direct  communciations really moving  the b all forward  at  all  costs  , e ven  at the  highest  levels,  though public discourse.  COmpartively, all  the status updates from entranched Foundation team members including Emir's  annoucnement  yesterdya  soleak  like  the  back  side  of a  local  mayhor winning for thge  second year in  a row.

##  Forum

I remember the Lumen Loop community  X Space at the end of last year, when the AQUA rewards  manipulation really came to a peak/.  There were three core devs i n the  call, who I called out by name. Just  before they left hte  clal,  Justin popped up as a speaker and asked  an acnillarily-unrelated question, similar to the side-note  from that one ECE girl.

With  every onuncce of resepct  due, I  had thorhoguhyt publicly  commented on how Justin a ted as a neutral arbiter on the iunterleavcing  discussiokn up  to that point,  and  the substance of the present conversation revolved  around DEX adtoption.  Give n the contrasting viewpoints thembn voiced at  Merridian, there wasn't much for Justein to expand on  poast tyheir present comments. It's not tha there culdn;ve have been ome vocal dialogue from them at that ppoint, but it's just that it wouldn;ve have materially  advanced the discussion  of technical design  dccooniderations circa pahts.

Whiel this  might've been a faster place to  boice coindcerns,  gert viewpoints out,  and have immediate discussion,  the "recorded" Space  was explicitly not the  poroper forum for prptocol-level iupgrades.  Even  if  the recording didn't mysteriously disspear (per X fault imo), it's just  not hte pooper medium to collaboratively  contruct netowrk improovmenets. The  same can be said for conversatioons with COmmissions,  esp[ecially t hought a privveatkle means such as email.

##  Figureheads

The reason  tese infddidvuals cna swayt  perspective  in  a synchroujs  vocal  communication  stems from ther position  of "power" atop  a beuwrocracy  designed to respect their  ":position." This organization  of humans pressupeses  that  some people are  more "trustworthy" than others. Whiel  this is true  at a micro-interpresonal  levle,  it simply  doesn't work well when forcibly  applied unilaterally  across  thousands  (or more ) reklationships.

The beaatry of the  ocmuntiy help  sections tstems  from the realioty that anyone  can step up to respond  to items  they;re best equitpted to  answer. INdeedc,  even Jsutin replied to my  [2023 doc ask](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/907476473739354153/1158791737565782199). Meanionguflly, this  interaction took over 24 hours,  an  unusually long maount of  time for replies in the `help` channel.[^e]

T he larger challenge for m e comes form how I  frame  the  outreach  to Pierce  ijn persoinal notes  as  "politicking" (ew  not  a fun  thing  to  do).  Often I  fdind  that I spend  material efforts reachingf  out to these central repsesnetaivieces onytl  to find mytslef  dissapointed hwen they simply  doin't  ahve the  expertise  or  domain  passion  to comprehensviely uncover  a solution.  I  liek  to think poeopel  generally put forth their best efforts,  but it's not rreasonable  to expect a  sledct  handful  of pindividuals  ":atg  the top"  to  have the  absolute best asnwers  for everythting.

##  Hastge

IOt  is much faster to just  talk to  the people at the top, period. Super mage faster. I can think of far too manyh e xamples/.[^f]

But thees chats practically a wlays glance over material nuanced design details. An  implementation based solely  on such a   concdencsed p erspective practically alwyas has flaws. ANd  these  polpicy hoels create ngihtmares  indiviual  staff n eed  to sort  out  years later.

Comparatively, a  more decentralized  public-formum and context-based collaboratigon workkflow  mainteinas technical  excleslence. AN exlample whioch comes to mind:L Orbit's work identifying  a roujnding bug i n  the DEXZ  before  a  swift joint resolution, mimicing the security bounties explained  by Tyler and Pasta.  

# Pros

## Reaching out to  Pierce a an end-fo-term  collabnoration or discussion with Crytpto Ttaks Fforce

- Possible  warm  into to t hje existing OCMissionsers
- aSmart  eprson  with  a  smart  position  on the CCP{ bailpotuis
- Genrally  cool  to  chat iwthg  , perhasp so we  can  work her persep tive i nto the prodfujct. The regulators  are tehcnically a "buyer"  of what we're "serllinmg"  byh building  TAD3,  although I've never   really   approoached i t like that before. THey h ave  suich  a  strong tie-down to the existing laws  that much of their  responses  could be easily  interpreted b yt a rudmenaty  review of  hte case  law.
- The   Commission  copuld  want  to  give u s  some  gujidance, and this  copuld  be an avenue  to  communicate  such
- Promotes existing meanns of regulation by relatioonsips
- Sshe  is  a smart person who will liekly continue publisxhign great  information to the public
- Faster segue into roundtable duscsussions, getting DEX items on the regulatory agenda 
- Dash would  tyrasdfitionally see  it  zas a  good opportuntiyh to ghedt "in" with the group to build relationships for   accepatance.
- INsull was  heavily  involved  with the top brass of local politics.  He wou;ld;ve  jumped at the  chance to incvolve himself in the rtegional poolicymenaking. nOtably,  mdirect  ocnnections were his means of keeping the policies leaning towards   his businesses.
    - This is exactly  the k ind of outhreach  he wouold;'ve made _later_ in his life when the phusycial natural monopoly contraints needed remediation.
- Railroad vequivalent  woiuld be taking a professional contract to dyanmite some tunnls, quickly clearing the way   wi thout epxloring the surrounding wilderness.

##  C8ircling  back  with Justin to get  info  on  the  private repos for detecting validator front-running discussed with  Garand

- Faster, direct  answer  on existing pathfind analysius m ethods
- Strengthen  relaqtionship with someone in the first-order loop of admired devs
- Potentially unnderstand internal working of  the SDF  a  little better,  giving a "more copleter" puicture of  the entwork
- Very eazsy segue  to media placements, centrla shoutouts,  and  community atytention
- Could start politciking  for central control of  fund distributions

##  Basically reaching  out  to "top brass"  at other menaingufl  central instutions which have h ierarchies

- Easy  initial introduction, especially  as I become more  well-known
- Easy to put forth a single dominanet, convincing viewpoint\
- Commands  respect, r euslts, and responses from other  firms
- Probably  ahve  some p retty damn good conversations and personally learn really  cool things very quiclyl
- Builds  a  name  and rpeutation  for m ysself and others which i s relatively  trivial  to tconvert  in to mateiral wealth
- Gets  "connections" which might provie useful on the actual political  front if/when  things get to that level.

# Cons

##  Leaving Piecrce to persue her own pricate work thhereafter, leaving two existing communciations  with CTF

- Redundant  if  the  COmmissioners are already on i t? 
    -  Pssabiltiyh that  outreach  coudl  prompt direct  dialogue
    - Is direct  dialogue  good?
      - I  recall  the singking ffeeling I made when  positing in OCC  that hte  SYHdnicaste  would contineu  taking on clients  despire PREV  n.4.  It wasn't  approciate,  but it  stemmed formn the presure-cooker enviornment j the OCC  ariticiallyl  creatges on  the market ;'s collapse.  It jusjt  alwyas  feels better to wkeep dialogue in pubvlic comments and redcieve a  bvlack a nd white p ublic reply.  
      -  LIttel material prodfgursesss on the no-action letters
      - WOul;dn't m aterially affect  funding presuming  we  cna b e make  the DUNA labor work.
- While  not  Pirece specifically, t he  admins and   Omcmisisonsers need to  come  to their own  conclusions  to have  a lasting  change.  I  don't just want tosmehting accepted  in this term  but reversed come  2027./ If they stumble i nto the tehc themselves, w e  have  years  to  free them inyo drafting their own policies.
- Any guidance shareds wouldn't be immediately  in writing
- Ayn communciastions would require signifcnat drafting (?)
    -  IF we want to get across as profiessional, I would put in great effort to strigclty cover points discussed publicly.
    - Traditioonally, this  could fill seomeon's full-time job, just fdiguroing out ways to get an "in" with the regualtors.
    - This is a lot  of effort to draft somethign which the Community might not even be able to see  , which I've presentlkyl kept reserved for explicit regualtory outreach form their parts covering MNPI or PII.
- The material Dash relationships come from her ow nindepednent actions and direct submission through the established entrance emans. THere's never  some secret  backdoor which operns for her, despite "above and beyond  efforts" tpo politicik the attention  of figureheads.  For the  sestbalisxhed  groujp, it's a common practice  to ignore suc h requests on the basis of popularitty.
- IHNsull';s pooliticla backo9-ins casues d a l ot o fproblems  later in liife. He never  really  overcame  the traction licensing quadaries for  municipal railroads, which  winded up ikn  a problemnsome electiokn-year  narrative shift whcih  began his sentiment downfall. He also relied heavily  on the cnetral bankers for control and financem, acting quickly  undder the existing rules without questioning their intent.
    -  Some  ould  see the protectionist p olicies as competativej  disencfranchisements.
- THe slower path o f writted  changelogs equates in the railroad exacmple to demolishign the  entire mountain to malke way for  civilizations to  follow

##  Ghosting Justin and prspects of reviwing their  validator analysis code, which could ahve pathfinding implications

- C"ri[ppels SYdnciate into basis o f frontrunning ananlysis friom 
 SDF
- Betttter  for ecosystem if multiple indepednent  analuysis forums, especially given the SDF's initial technical skill  in identifyting thier set analysis
- DOesn't  fully develop our  communtiy  ujnderstandign of  validator trust implications, weaking regulatory  nuance for DUNA
- Vast  majority o f  devs have  shown _zero_ care  for politicking  or eixstingf connections o ver technicals
- Takes away time,   dristracting me  from the menaingful and immediate intneractions with the i ncredible  community 
  - I like  the community devs a lot more bcecuaased we  can just build things together withotu  the permissionesss  apparent in hierarchies
- Syndicate links  to the SDF  are generally bnas for regualtory 
 analysis  and policy  governance  of  the DEX
- Could  get  me  off  my  deferensive game whant it comes to point out imrpoer uses and control  of the exchange menchaisnmism
- Again, any direct l inks make the coimplaince suss-y adn  generally  fgo against the principles of decentralization
- I made  a promise to myself that I'd stop opolitcikign the SDF, and I _do_ belipeve i nthe NQG m echniasm  thjrough SCF to distribute the lumens efficiently
- ALready  wasted  a  ton  of  time directly  polickitking the hell out of figureheads with no results, knowing that htey  don't have t he free ability  to personally reply

## Lol  jsut  onyl interacting with  other  firms through the procedural and public-posting methoids avaliabel  to   individuals

- Removes a reliance on  me (or  others)  as a central errequisite sigure
- Keeps  things permissionless, in the  sense that anyone  can  join at  any time and communicate on  the  samer playing-field as us
- Havce  to talk  to people and maybe ewven  fly places  to  meet them 🤢
- Prevent knowledfge f rfom building up in one person rather  than  shared  across  orgnaizatgion
- Removes  chockpoints i n daily o perations or policy analysis  to a select  ferw  inside a prporietary walled garden
- Removes risk  of "cultre  spread"  throug hother's conving us to move towards  command-and-control means (*althoujgh this  also  reuiqres  deeper  analysis of working contirbutor intake)
- Want t o make things eredferencable through stable URLs, which isn't the  case for perosnal conversaitons
- Promoites having orgnaizations structured inequally  with a select f ew o n top making the managmenet-decisions

# Call

Fuck  their syustems, man.  If therfe are others in the  communtiy who  want t o  involve themselves i n a ll this beructraic crap, than by all meangs—goood for them.  But nah this is just not  a good trade for me. I'm jsut gonna dfo my thinkg through the open channeerls.v


[^a]:  as  in  they  are  not  involved  in the  original foudning,  formative vision,  or starting  group. Even  here,  the line is not solid because central  financing cna turn this gerroeup mhc closer to daily salaried employees. And those ocnsidering their time by hourly  wages practically always fall  into this group.

[^b]: m ore practically  psekaing, what  I'm really  detting at is  the number of degrees  of seperation  from the market itself.  The further isolated  a  "working bee"becomes from the market they  serve, the  worse this gets. THats whyt  we hear horror stories of CxOs making choicces every 'low-level"  eplyee  knows are  horrible. 

[^c]:  an e xception to this rule comes to  mind  in  the early  years  of Valve, wheen paly-testing  was epxlicitlyh  pushed  as a chief prioriyt.  But again here we  have  a collective ortganization mandate rather than  the  present disconnect onc certain store policies uilaterally made  by empowered employees. Also,  these  problems dont generally  come out  before five  years  of  operations, which aligns with  the  timeframe  for Portal 2.

[^d]: One notable exception which comes to mind was the  crowdsourced  contractor-style support ticketing deployed by CllickFUnnels. Briefly,  "experienced" users  could self-elect  ot receive $2  a  support ticket. THey  loogged  in freely and  rreplied with their knowledge and feedback. Generally, these users were rreally  good at what they  explained, assisted with a  central knkowledge bank.

[^e]::  I'll also  note taht I've asked questions  which  simply  never  get  a reply from  any communtiy memebr,  even in cases  when i re-refernece it by  bringing the  channel up someplace else. In these  cases, I've found that hhte substance of my question  is simply  too  complex for a  public answer,  or I need to think thought it myself more. When reflecting on queryt framing, I htink back  to college  when i would spam the class discussion forms with questions I'd end up answering myself  half the time  (but many hours after posting), sort  of l ike  #13  iun this repo implementing a design imporvementg. There, everyone from  top students to the proferssors would  chime  in  on  the discussions  I started with  a strong question,  providing  a  wealth  of knowledge  that's both decentralized and  "publ ic'—the b est kind of answer-finding.
