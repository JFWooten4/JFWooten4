# Diction Surrounding the GameStop Short Sneeze

I need to decide whether or not to adopt Chive's dictions around the buy-button turnoff being a "Position-close only" event v. referencing the entire fiasco as an unprecedented limit of transactional capabilities.

## Pros (PCO)
- Succinct
- Easy to incorporate into a sentence as a reference
- Unworkable logistically in the context of the uptick rule (would effectively freeze all trading)
- Specific
- Relatively bland for a public audience
- Implicates why buys take no margin

## Cons (favor of removing rights)
- Sounds more meaningful
- Not a sort of technical lingo
  - Easier for the public to understand
  - More emotional connotations
  - Pits one party (buyers) against another (shorts)
- Vague and/or wordy (in the explanation setup)
  - Allows you to add emotion by really telling a story with it though

# Call

Use PCO in references with strict regulatory context; a more elaborate convo in public settings.
