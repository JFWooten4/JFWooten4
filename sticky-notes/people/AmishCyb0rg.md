Some reseriosu potnential here on the Fed sentiments  form DUNA cheets as marketing intros. It  was a basis f rom Fridal which led direfctly to the securitization schats  generally  hypothesisxzed from [elementary](freedomfromgovernment.org) with may 2025 retort:

> Started going into the materials and really liked the first "Let Go of Fear" module from the _Feed the Dam_ series. Completely agree with the ridiculousness of government-sponsored (and hence controlled) food-supply production. And really appreciated the point midway through where the presenter comments that the only thing which can bring change is a small, passionate, and informed group of activists. ðŸ’œ

> As for all the money securitized with your signature, I caught tidbits of the sentiments here throughout the lessons I heard so far. ðŸ§  I completely agree how ridiculous it is that everything becomes an embeddedness to the money masters running the BS FRS. I remember chatting with these assholes over the years, but not heard about 1099As!
