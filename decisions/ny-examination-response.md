I need to decide whether or not to reply to the Commission's NY regional office request through GitHub.

The status quo is to report through a PDF created in the general cloud computing services available to the syndicate through Zoho. It is relatively trivial to type the thing up there, and I've already imported the request items to a written document.

Communications with staff are extremely important for the Syndicate. Even a "clerical" mistake such as backdating documents can lead to serious problems because that implies material management inadequacies. They have a very deeply-rooted control prerogative which the Syndicate will need to fall under, especially if they add a new `Ad-17` series requirement for a TAD/.

They have requested certain items which need to be communicated privately.[^s] But there are very large amounts of things I want to write which have material bearing on the governance of everything, international securities compliance, and general public safety.

[^s]: _See, e.g._ 17f-2 fingerprinting for executive signers. But even this point relates to very significant policy decisions such as our more complete response concerning what entails a signing entity under a cryptographic key-auth scheme for a flat organization, another item they've requested material documentation on.

Should the security of public discourse come before the nature of our own communications with the Commission? _Relevantly_, the request for documents they submitted was marked as confidential. At least in the communication means under which it was transmitted.

They sent a lot more than the 25 questions, including quite poignantly the contact information for three people. It starts at the lowest "rung" of the ladder with the Lead Examiner, and then it escalated to their boss of examinations and that person's assistant regional director.

There's something about that that's really wrong, but I completely lost my train of thought tracking down the complex chain to the source document which detailed the explicit undermining relationship.

### Appendix

No matter what happens, I plan to post the response publicly, whether it's through a simple but maybe timely[^sss] conversion from Writer to markdown OR something easier like a public share link to the non-PII response item. The question here is whether or not to make that latter part itself on GitHub first (as in there is no proprietary internal doc). Then I just link them to the repo permalink vs. sending a PDF.[^o]

[^sss]: Probably take like, idk, 30 minutes tops.

[^o]: I might still send them a cover letter which contains the link in something that's a couple sentences and then a direct href, for posterity and professionalism. But it would be all material info on GH.

## Pros (make GH only)

- More transparent, but only by a little bit
  - You would get public commit history
  - Order of how things are added could be referenced
- Easier to write on Markdown

## Cons (just PDF it)

- More customization on the lettering format through ODF
  - Can have formal I. B. c) section, subsection, and subsubsectioning

## Call

In interpreting these two's correspondences so far, it's pretty clear that they arenâ€™t ready to see it yet. Thus, PDF it is!
