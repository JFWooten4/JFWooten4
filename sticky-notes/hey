Hello,

I believe I have made a duly-formed request, as this is the same means its submission used in FOIA Request No. 24-01211-E.

If I am in error, would you be ever so kind as to let me know where I went wrong?

The request is in [note 141] (https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-occ-2025-801/srocc2025801-598095-1737722.pdf#page=50) and uses substantially the same language as my last fulfilled {{ALASKA}}.

In good faith,
John Wooten
