Hi @everyone,
I haven't heard back from the grant yet, but hopefully that will support our hiring of devs.

The plan since early on (we were first denied for 50k at the end of 2022) was to use those community funds to build out the frontend based on the (continuing) years of work I've put into the backend. Long-term, I'd love to open-source it so that we can have common global settlement. :handshake:

Common global settlement, imo, redefines how we approach capitalism. It's been an enlightening journey taking TAD3 from an idea to proper documentation/SEC review. However, all this research and development has been effectively self-funded, per our startup post.

I'm at a crossroads. :railway_track:

Recently upon reflecting I came to the conclusion that raising money was a good next step for BT.

We're at the point where we really need development help to flesh out the interface with TAD3.
As I've said in the Discord, I'm starkly against raising and will not sell traditional equity.
If I was to go down that rabbit hole, I would sell capped-profit contracts like OpenAI. :money_with_wings:

We can't let TAD3, or whatever we all ultimately use (nothing similar I know of) fall victim to the same rent-seeking incentives plaguing DTCC. :earth_africa:
Just last week dozens of industry experts expressed bafflement at how slow stocks clear when Amazon delivers in an hour, by one Seattle man's account.

This is something important, and that's why I was so excited the day I learned about the WhyDRS community and movement.

I actually couldn't tear myself away from the computer long enough to eat a meal the first day I found the WhyDRS site.
After a minor passing out, I still could not believe an active group of other people understood and cared about these massive hidden market problems. :star2:
More specifically, I was so overcome with fulfillment that I proposed to my girlfriend (of 3 years, similar to BT). (she said yes)

I am building this the right way, or not at all. :100:

That's why I'm setting up a GH sponsor page to keep my work alive, community-focused, and nonprofit.
If you support democratizing capitalism, freeing our markets from Wall St, and decentralized independent money management, please learn more at https://sponsor.jfwooten4.com/

Either way, this community is truly incredible and will always have my ongoing support. :purple_heart:

### Hello investors, innovators, and developers 💜

My name is John Wooten, and I've been working on [TAD3](https://www.tad3.dev) for [three years](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/1015) without material compensation. This is my full-time job, although I've steered away from easy early revenue or funding. If you might subscribe to an affordable amount each month, I will prudently steward your funds towards building web3's stock market infrastructure. 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 Any amount helps—monthly contributions are most obliged!

### Give and give 🌱

If you've been following me for a while, you might notice the dozens of courses, handful of free books, and plethora of open thought pieces I publish for anyone to read anywhere, anytime. Growing up, [I learned](https://x.com/JFWooten4/status/1769775991902105870) how to sell information, but it fundamentally misaligned with my values. While I could go down the proprietary path of extracting maximum rents from my creative work, I'd much rather distribute it for free so that it might help new investors like myself starting out without hundreds (or even thousands) to drop on their education.

Especially for fans abroad just trying to get a leg up on poverty, I just don't see the need to profit from giving them educational materials, especially around basic financial and personal development courses. Knowledge is money when it extends your fiscal time horizon, and I just don't see the need to gatekeep that basic tool. So I publish for free, and I publish for everyone. I don't take BS sponsorships, and I don't promote my own interests. It's all around sharing quality education for "investors like us who don't have a Ph. D. in finance or millions to invest," as [I put it](https://podcast.jfwooten4.com).

**So if you align with that vision of a more inclusive financial future, please consider a monthly donation within your means. 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼**

### Limited early opportunity

This is your chance to support a passionate young advocate for decentralizing capitalism, unshackling our markets from the [tight grip](https://youtu.be/YUwqzeaR1lA) of [Wall Street](https://youtu.be/JGWN1-I8Kac), and pioneering the movement towards decentralized, independent [money management](https://www.ninetonoonsecrets.com/free-book). 🌟 With a vision that stretches beyond the conventional boundaries of finance, I aim to bridge the gap between the everyday individual and the often inaccessible world of investing. 🌍💼

Driven by the belief that [financial literacy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWUFvhKuc_5u5CR31Nr-dArLS1U_namsc) and access should be [universal rights](https://youtu.be/FwjDQ-h3TQE), not privileges, my journey has been dedicated to [breaking down](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWUFvhKuc_5vyAfq_AbWz-wSl82p_xtH9) complex [financial concepts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWUFvhKuc_5tD0NuFpppsQotuOj9T892C) into [understandable](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWUFvhKuc_5uRBw4Im9VfnkBIOopUJJ3i), [actionable](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWUFvhKuc_5u7Qm6Hj-ahiZ9_C0A5zKAE) [knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWUFvhKuc_5vGmiWsKgmra0qI8cXOLxmE). 📚💡 Through innovative use of blockchain technology, I work tirelessly to create platforms that empower individuals to manage their finances independently, fostering a system where trust is built on transparency and control is in the hands of the many, not the few. 🔗🔐

### Donate, decentralize, and prosper 🌍

My commitment to [freeing our markets](https://thesis.jfwooten4.com) from Wall Street's dominance is rooted in the conviction that [true progress](https://explainer.jfwooten4.com) and [innovation](https://www.whydrs.org) in finance can only occur in a system that values and supports the contributions of independent money managers and investors. 💪📈 By championing the principles of decentralized finance, I am not just advocating for a shift in how we manage money, but for a fundamental transformation in how we perceive value, community, and the potential for collective empowerment. 🚀❤️

Join me in this [journey](https://www.blocktransfer.com/blog/author/wooten/) towards a future where finance is fair, accessible, and in service of the many, paving the way for a world where every individual has the opportunity to achieve financial independence and prosperity. 🤝

I am an investor-turned-developer who cares deeply about financial markets. Briefly, the infrastructure of yesteryear hinders humanity's growth, despite widespread adoption. The solution requires deep nonprofit roots, which means I presently make no income other than here. 💜
