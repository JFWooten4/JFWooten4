in an itnerview with TabbFORUM's Bruce Morris at Consensus on 13 June 2024, the  @nchakar said "DTCC's mission is to ensure the safety and soundness of the markets." THey "make sure everything settles , everythign's accounted for" and want to " do exactly same thing that we do for traditional assets for digital assets." She goes on to say that "we don't really compete" and the conglomorate is "the center of gravity that can pull the indsutry together and[] get us to march in one direction."

DTCC hireded a new managing director for thier U.S. Digital Assets program 30 sep 2025. Three years ago, he was on a DTCC-sponsored webinar discussing t+0 clearing with CBDCs at https://www.ftfnews.com/event/webinar-clash-or-convergence. with four boogy boards behind him, Thomas said "the risks fears that go along with cryptocurrenccy and some of the wonky thigns that happen there; hard forks, 51% attacks, and things like that; may not be an issue if we're talking abotu things that DTCC is doing with private, permissioned blockchains."
