# Disction Surorunding the GameStop Short Sneeze

I need to decide whether or not ot adpot Chive's dictions around the buy-button turnoff being a "Position-close only" event v. referencing the entire fiasco as an unprecesdentel limit of transactional capapbilities. 

## Pros (PCO)
- Succinct
- Easy to incorproate into a setnence as a reference
- UNworkablke logistically in the context of the uptick rule (would effectively freeze all trading)
- Specific
- Relatively bland for a public audience
- Implicates why buiys take no margin

## Cons (favor of removing rights)
- Sounds more meaningful
- Not a sort of technical lingo
  - ERasier for the public to understand
  - More emotional comnnotations
  - Pits one partyt (buyers) against another 9shots)
- Vague and/or wordy (in the explanation setup)
  - Allows you to add emotion by really te;lling a story with it tho

# Call

Use PCO in refrences with strict regulatory context; a more elebaoreate convo in public settings.
