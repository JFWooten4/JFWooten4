## Background

I've used a lot of stories in the past throughout my comments. And I will continue to use my experiences to shape regulatory viewpoints. I only find it prudent to fully contextualize my thoughts with formative background.

Today I was reminded of Matthew's dedicated transformation shortly after meeting Kayla. I remember visiting him for one of the last times at an on-campus church house party. After everything, he just walked away from the promising career and future of some dreams for God.

Just before winter break in 2020, we went to a rooftop bar called Six Feet Under. Once we ate, we walked across the street through the cemetery a little (it was very big). I remember finding it on the fun food tour with Kayla through the area just a little bit later.

It was one of the last times I was pictured with that trading necklace. Those moments of physical accessory change have meant so much to me as I repeatedly shed away past forms of self. I'm now facing the tall challenge of how much to feature that personality in regulatory submissions.

## Materiality

I remember growing up, wanting to play music. And more than the trombone I was waltzed into by circumstance and peers. We had that awesome old Yamaha keyboard from the basement, and I designed my whole room around it.

The crown joy was getting Ableton and the Push. I remember getting the middle-school admin to sign a document affirming my enrollment as a student so that I could get the software discount. I was so into it for so long before I really found markets through Tea Fortress and later day trading.

The turnaround was relatively quick; only a couple years at most seriously playing around with the sounds. But it was exceptionally freeing, like I had the complete power to create my own art manifesting everything I knew and loved. While trading had that to an extent in the limited context of asset venue, it always had strict rules mandating disciplined compliance.

Now, for really the first time, I've had the freedom in the bounds of community discussions with others who get the problem, and it's been just a blast scoping out the market I want to create. I took such a big leap singling out the DTCC very early on, and all those accusations proved exactly right. I want to trust in myself and create this whole new industry.

## Situation

In drafting the final response to the first Syndicate Examination, I need to decide whether or not to deeply implicate my own persona. I am particularly contemplating whether or not to include in the full public form a photo of me in front of the New York Physical Address building. One other item includes a sidebar on personal frugality made professional objective.

### Pros (include narrative image)

- Personal touch making for convincing immediate arguments
- I've seen the effect a strong framing vision can have
  - Jed's early work laying foundational principles, even if ignored
  - SBF's departure and easy contrast with formative statements :(
  - Nakamoto's shaping and direct encoding of software law; dead
- There is nobody else alive that comprehends this as well as I
- (Minor) more information in the public archive outside attachments
- There is so much at stake in this war, and I'd be foolish to hold anything back without due political reasoning

### Cons

- Greatly increased risk of centralizing around my own thoughts
  - I could become a focus of ongoing developments rather than the actions and legislations themselves
  - I'm scared of how I've used my voice in the past, expressing beyond reasonableness to educate
  - The past policy choices were made in a vacuum, but the best ones require input from all
- (Maybe a Pro?) Now that the address is public in the interim between expansion, it could all end here
  - Framing while around sets course for future reference, especially if any development strays away
  - Speaking too demonstrably about their systems with direct identity makes me an easier target
  - Martyrdom is not the objective even if it would move things forward politically quite well

### Call

It's a weight between centralization and integrity, which I've never really faced before. In the balance lays isolation of Syndicate team members, which I sincerely desire to minimize through the automation of PII and MNPI processing, so that everything can live on the GitHub.

When planning out this last week of writing, I figured I'd need to collapse and rely on sugar to fuel efforts for the last six days. I at least expected two binges towards the end to get the final thoughts across with document PDF compilation.

But I've been sincerely impressed by Kyle's ability to step up, albeit greatly dependent on my own commitment to take a break to acquire significant food stock. I'm thinking quite clearly in relaxation because of these combined efforts, and I believe autonomous decentralized self-interested individuals will stand up and answer my pleas for a ~~better~~ new free way if I step up and give them the call to contribute.
