## Context

I need to run toth e end of 723, which consisites of the remaining SDEX and custodial-signatures work. THe multisig items have zero existing efforts outside of the years of experiene. The SDEX part continges on a timely respons to Johan for documenting pathfinding.

I've started a draft with singifacnt prior context on the assistance plea, whcih I think would land more squarely with the S-D#1496 in an expanded flow. If I give na exmaple of adding a page for the ManageData there, I have a really strong basis to ask for their help doing the smae. Good idea no matter what.

## Matter at Hand

Whether or not to have a reflection day before startign the findal run-through, but after the routing help;.

## Pros

- Some time to relax
- MMentally map out how we want to conslucede all the info
- Review internally the politicial points which were crucially included in my present CA
- Speed comes from adequate parreparation
- John happy easy quick way

## Cons

- SLower
- Potentially a day off the end to finish the signatures
  - This or more rush during SDEX parth
  - Generally, my plan is to comprehnesnively complete the SDEX page mbefore even considering moving ionto multisig
    - Muktisign is already pretty complette
    - Tghere;'s a lot of new stuff with Soroban authorization whcih isin a compeltely sepeerate documentatioein page
    - Stuill real question based on march exchange with Tyler as to the interposition of classic and Soroban signers
- Relatively duplicative of after-TAR1/SEC-reply time away
- Do i really need mroe time to [prepare for the terminius , given this is pretty mechnical work rather than inspired?
  - It really stems to the techinal points, but I just care about them far too much

## Call

The next thing I have to implmenet (lol post-gov) is how to implmenet the EDGAR Next API, so let's get his out, reflect after it's done but before the traversal, and then that gives them a full 24 extra hours to review things.
