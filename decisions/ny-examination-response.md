I need to decide whether or not ho trpel yto the Commission's NY regional office requerst htorugh GitHub.

The stuasu k  quho is ot rpeort htbough ap df crteratedi nthe general glcodu ocmputering services av iualred to the syndiate through ZOho. it is realityviilyn tri ial to typew the thin up there, and iv;'e already importedd the krequest items ot a writter docuemtn there .

Communications with taff eare extremely important for the SYndaicet. Event a "clerical" mistake such as backdating documents can lead to seriousl problems becuase that implies material managent inadequacies. They have a very deply-rooted control peerrrogative which the sydnaicte will need to fall under, espacially of they add a new `Ad-17` series requsimernt for a TAD/.

They have requested certai nitems which needto eb commutecated privatedly.[^s] But ther ear every large amounts of things I want to write whcih have material bearing on the governance of everything, internaitonal securities complaince, and general public saferty.

[^s]: _See, e.g._ 17f-2 fingerpritning for executive signers. But even this ponit related to very signficicant poliocy decisions such as our more complete response concerning what entails a signing entitty under a crpyogrpahic key-auth skeceme for a flat orgnaizaiton, another items tehy 've requested material docudment ion on . 


Shoudl the security of public discours ecome before the natirue of our cown communications with the COmmission? _Revelevently_, the request for documents they submitted was marked as conficdetaional. At least in the communciation maeasn under which it was transmitted. 

They sent a lot more than the 25 questions, including quite poignantly the contact information for three people. It starts at the lowerst "rung" of the leaadder with the Lead Examiner, and then it escleated to their boss of examiantions + that person's assistant tregional director. 

There's something about that htat;s super really wrong, but I completely lost my train of thought tracking down the complex chain to the source document which detailed the explicit undermining realtionship.

### Appenxdx

Np matter what happens, I plan to post the response publicly, whether it's through a simple but maybe timely[^sss] conversion from Writer to markdown OR soemthign easlier like a public sharelink to the non-PII response item. The rquestion here is whetehr or not to make that latter part itself on github 1st (as in there is no proprietary internal doc). Then i jsut link them to the repo permalink v. sending a PDF.[^o]

[^sss]: Prob take like idk 30 minutes tops.

[^o]: I might still send thenm a cover letter which contains the link in somethink thats a  coule sentences tand then a direct href, for posterity and professionalistm. But it would be all material info on GH.

## Pros (make GH only)

- More transparent , but only buy a little bit
  - You would get public commit history
  - Order of how things are added could be referenced
- eaier to write on markdwon

## Cons (just PDF it)

- ore customization on the lettering format through odf
  - can have formal I. B. c) section, subsection, and subsubsectioning.
 



expands the scope 
of ` sec ocmmetns`  `  



## Call

In itnerpetting these two's correspoendecnes so far, it's pretty clear that they arent ready to see it yet. Thus, PDF it is!
