I need some naming rules to keep clean boundaries:

### Discord Accounts

| Porson is girl
|   Could this relationship have a clear, immediate, business purpose
|     Yes
|       switch venue:
|         con -> n64retro
|         PT -> n64retro
|         online form -> existing intro
|     No
|       switch resationship status:
|   Single[^vi]
|     -> n64retro
|   Unknown resationship status

[^vi]: The only acceptions to this are Suri and Vylet, who need to stay on `john`
