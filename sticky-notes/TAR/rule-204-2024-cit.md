See 89 FR 105152 nn.1–3 and accompanying text where the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis reports “8,378 average daily fail to deliver positions” at a registered clearing agency under 17 CFR § 242.204 as recently as 2023. See also explicit past short-selling reforms under Part 242 "protecting the independent pricing mechanism of the securities market so that” issuers raise funds given the “natural forces of supply and demand unencumbered by artificial forces” like clemency over FTDs, available at https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2007/34-56206.pdf. Despite these promulgated written commitments, DERA staff remark that the rule "help[s] further the Commission’s goal of addressing potentially abusive 'naked' short selling[,]" plainly acknowledging blatant continued contradictions to the Commission’s mandate to facilitate capital formation at legitimate prices without flagrant centralized distortion through counterfeit stock. Why do we still need OMB’s approval for "1,506,165 hours [of paperwork] per year" to enforce byzantine 2000s-oversight mandates because the clearing monopoly refuses to deploy beneficial tracking seen abroad?
