This list ignores [formative education](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWUFvhKuc_5ttS7F3BRXE4-NS4A-5VgA3), which includes at least hundreds of writings.[^1] There are also at least 400 finished audiobooks from the free/included Audible catalog which I obviate in favor of purchased titles, some of which might be out there because they were from a 2-for-1 sale. I'm moving on now to my own audio renderings using the WW tools, so the consumption can be much more intentful rather than just all business and self-help category titles available.

[^1]: I'll include all the books I've kept over the years, but I do recall twiddling down my collection. Particularly, I donated the excess I didn't have room for when moving from college to my first shared apartment with my dad. This removed much of the Brunson marketing books in particular plus some other early developments which I found less meaningful.
