Political pushback as decentralizing necessity in last administration shown to no longer matter.

Chives discovery as a new thing on edge of selling.

Some will look back at what I do and call it socialism. It is not.

What is your incentive to work each day? Reward from labor inspires creativity.

Still necessary even in humanitarian work to reflect quantified impact.

GT 2x phone raising and tracking. Hard physically to talk to people with Asperger's.

Wouldn't give me a modest pay raise from base $10 minimum, and so completely don't see incentivized.

It's given me an incredibly sharp skill set to develop relationships, while showing me that I deserve (?) some new better.

Syndicate as MY asset management vehicle, and if you don't like what I'm doing with our CAPITAL then you can shove off or initiate a DUNA vote to remove me as asset manager (hopefully not name CEO here if. possible to somehow get that in the statuhorp stuff or even just a remapping of what CEO is if we want to file as an investment company with ~~SEC~~ the IRS)

its very different from protocol governance 

you actually have a direct say in that and we r statutorily bound to responsibilities (TA3 Standards, eg)
