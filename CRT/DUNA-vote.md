## Title

DUNA Ownership, Governance, and Stewardship of BlockTransfer


## Body

### Preface

First and foremost, information regarding this proposal was presented orally at the [ Custody Conference](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1435315414333788302) today. To account for the delay in publishing this talk, I've set the maximum voting timeframe (to 30 days). 

Generally, I do not like using videos as (primary) sources for governance proposals. Doing so soems sloppy, takes vuch longer to skim, and can't be easily released on  subscription feeds. 

However,the contents of this proprsal have been in the works for two years,and feedback has deen good so far. Moreover, this is a nonbinding sentiment vote to greenlight implementation work. 


### Substance 

I propose to donate all or part of the shares in [BlockTrans Syndicate](https://www.issuers.info/1846058) by the end of the year. this can be done through a standard ownership transfer, encumberment, or assidgnment - based on an implementation I will subsequently propose 

BT is an SEC-regulated transfer agent,and our work last year cleared up that this can stay seperate from ownership oversight. i envision it acting as a market-utility business that contributes to our nonprofit mission. 


### Budget 

i do not feel comfortable asking the DUNA for funds allocatohd to this proposal. Once we have sentiment affirmed, it should be a relatively straightforward transfer process with the Syndicate acting as its own agent (as resolved last AGM).

If you would like to show your support monetarily,please consider donating (not tax-exempt) directly to one of my accounts. there is a law firm ive followed aver che years through my preliminary design explorations, but I don't think this is the best use of DUNA funds

The purpose of this resolution is to clearly determine whether the DUNA:

•

Stewardship Principles

If adopted, the DUNA affirms the following principles:

1. Perpetual Mission Alignment
Any shares received shall be held exclusively to support the WhyDRS mission and public-interest objectives.


2. Non-Extractive Ownership
Ownership shall not exist for private enrichment, speculation, or financial extraction.


3. Protection Against Capture
Shares shall be held and governed in a manner designed to prevent concentration of control inconsistent with mission purposes.


4. Long-Term Stewardship Duty
The DUNA acknowledges this role represents an ongoing governance responsibility extending indefinitely into the future.



 “Yes” vote affirms that the DUNA is willing to become the legal owner of all Block Transfer shares upon donation and to hold them indefinitely in service of the WhyDRS mission.

A “No” vote indicates the DUNA does not wish to accept this responsibility.






3. Any shares received will be held solely in furtherance of the WhyDRS mission.


4. Ownership is not for private enrichment or speculative gain.


5. Appropriate legal and governance structures may be developed to facilitate the transfer.
