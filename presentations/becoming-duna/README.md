Syndicate as MY asset management vehicle, and if you don't like what I'm doing with our CAPITAL then you can shove off or initiate a DUNA vote to remove me as asset manager (hopefully not name CEO here if. possible to somehow get that in the statuhorp stuff or even just a remapping of what CEO is if we want to file as an investment company with ~~SEC~~ the IRS)

its very different from protocol governance 

you actually have a direct say in that and we r statutorily bound to responsibilities (TA3 Standards, eg)
