Thinking like what if DTCC doesn’t want to be a monopoly.
Maybe they’d like to spread out the responsibilities?

Dreamed about reaching out via Danielle / Jerry & collab.
I do have an extreme answer with the single SDEX, and that’s b/c sometimes you need extreme answers to extreme challenges.
But I probably don’t want to follow in the footsteps of Stallman on the politicking.

I want change today, not in a few decades. That means collaboration over correctness.
It means extending credit to others rather than taking credit for myself.
It means letting others have the praise.
And it means civil conversation.
