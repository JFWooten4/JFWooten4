Yes — this is exactly the right moment to shift from “discussing” to articulating the mandate.

At this stage you do not want a super-legalistic document.
You want something that reads like a constitutional resolution:

Clear
Serious
Principled
Understandable to voters
Historically durable

Think: foundational charter language, not contract language.

Below is a clean first draft you can react to. We can refine tone later (more formal, more plain, more on-chain style, etc.).

Draft — DUNA Stewardship Mandate Resolution

Title

Resolution to Affirm Stewardship Mandate for Block Transfer Shares


---

Background / Recitals

WHEREAS, the WhyDRS mission exists to advance and protect direct ownership of securities, investor rights, and transparent market infrastructure;

WHEREAS, Block Transfer, Inc. operates as regulated transfer agent infrastructure aligned with these mission objectives;

WHEREAS, long-term mission integrity requires that critical market infrastructure remain protected from private capture, speculative control, or mission drift;

WHEREAS, the founder and current shareholder of Block Transfer has expressed intent to donate all shares of the company into permanent stewardship for the benefit of the WhyDRS mission;

WHEREAS, the DUNA is a legally recognized entity capable of holding assets, including corporate shares, in furtherance of its charitable and governance purposes;


---

Statement of Intent

The purpose of this resolution is to clearly determine whether the DUNA:

• Accepts the responsibility to serve as permanent steward of Block Transfer
• Is willing to become the legal owner of its shares
• Agrees to hold such shares solely in furtherance of mission objectives

This resolution does not execute a transfer of shares.
Rather, it affirms acceptance of the role and authorizes preparation for such transfer.


---

Stewardship Principles

If adopted, the DUNA affirms the following principles:

1. Perpetual Mission Alignment
Any shares received shall be held exclusively to support the WhyDRS mission and public-interest objectives.


2. Non-Extractive Ownership
Ownership shall not exist for private enrichment, speculation, or financial extraction.


3. Protection Against Capture
Shares shall be held and governed in a manner designed to prevent concentration of control inconsistent with mission purposes.


4. Long-Term Stewardship Duty
The DUNA acknowledges this role represents an ongoing governance responsibility extending indefinitely into the future.




---

Resolution

RESOLVED, that the DUNA hereby explicitly affirms its willingness to accept the permanent stewardship role for Block Transfer, Inc.;

RESOLVED, that the DUNA agrees in principle to become the legal owner of all Block Transfer shares upon their donation;

RESOLVED, that such shares shall be held solely in furtherance of the WhyDRS mission and not for private financial gain;

RESOLVED, that the DUNA authorizes the development of appropriate legal, governance, and operational structures necessary to facilitate this stewardship transfer.


---

Effect of Adoption

Adoption of this resolution:

• Confirms acceptance of stewardship responsibility
• Establishes a clear governance mandate
• Authorizes preparation for future share donation and registration

Adoption does not:

• Immediately transfer shares
• Create financial obligations
• Alter current operations of Block Transfer


---

Why this structure works

This draft:

• Focuses on acceptance, not mechanics
• Makes the responsibility explicit
• Creates a permanent historical record
• Avoids premature legal commitments
• Signals seriousness and legitimacy

It reads much closer to a:

> Mission governance charter resolution



than a transaction document — which is exactly what you want for Layer 1.


---

Next step options

From here we can tune it depending on your needs:

We can adjust for:

• More formal / corporate tone
• More DAO-native tone
• Shorter on-chain readable version
• Inclusion of CRT language references
• Alignment with DUNA governance format

OR we can also draft the voter explanation summary that would accompany this resolution.

Just tell me where you want to go next.
