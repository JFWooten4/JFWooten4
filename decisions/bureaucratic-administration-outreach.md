First of all, some sick-ass trades lately in the real financial markets. So fucking pissed it's taking two weeks to move money around after initiating transfers early this month. Fuck you, banks, and fuck you, Wall Street.

Probably shouldn't be including that kind of context in a decision like this, but man, this is a pretty material one. It incorporates a lot of experience over a diverse six years of navigating bureaucracies. It reminds me of the [letter](../static/srcs/trimbath-stanford-letter.pdf) I wrote to Trimbath some time back.

# Context

I've found that there are two kinds of engineers. The first receive a paycheck from a central organization definitively not of their design.[^a] The others find something they want to work on and then they just do it.

It's a deep-rooted personal perspective which I generally see stems from early educational experiences. And this isn't to say that it's a permanent classification. But it is a present identification flag which someone needs to change or maintain on their own.[^b]

I find that this perspective works its way into responses to public feedback or generally suggestions. With the exception of job mandates from "above" to consider viewpoints, the former group can often incidentally ignore market feedback.[^c] Conversely, the latter generally consider, reply, and listen to market feedback.

## Journey

It's a long path from the central norms of yesteryear to the independent decentralization availed by modern blockchain technology. One form which comes to mind is that Trimbath letter, sent using outdated snail mail. The address was invalid, and so she didn't even receive the post.

Sometimes it feels like this with central organizations, even if a message gets delivered. Something that comes to mind: the Bernie Madoff whistleblower who never won because his tip was tragically forwarded to the New Jersey investigation office rather than New York. The equivalent I've seen is reaching out to someone in the org who just doesn't directly relate.

They don’t relate to what you're putting down, they don't understand where you're coming from, and they might not even care about the underlying ethos you're pushing across. And, from the outside looking in, someone's interests can be extremely challenging to gauge based on public profiles, job titles, and perhaps departments. This leaves most outreach in the form of spamming "heads" of departments or the C-suite, since they're the only people who you can rely on to care about larger items.

## Materials

Dare I say most outreach should be for larger items. There are customer support channels or search engines for the smaller things. Even with the TA outreach about TAD3, it was so clear that the de-minimis daily job employees just couldn't care less about more systemic changes.

I really don't like needing centralized support channels. It always feels like I'm just a number waiting in line for some crappy government services. But this seems like the most common way to provide help through a central means.[^d]

Comparatively, I've found extremely satisfying support through the community help outreach channels in Stellar and even some interplaced DRS chats over the years. There are active latter-type engineers who actually want to grow the community and teach others, ready to answer questions on a moment's notice. And over time you actually build relationships with these people, collaborating towards shared objectives through productive exchanges.

## Teams

This is where we get to team formation, something which reminds me of being picked last in gym growing up. The central version of creating teams is really inefficient. You put out these “requirements” where far too many people submit general “good-looking” pieces of paper summarizing their career.

Now you have to extensively discuss their background, spend literal days of your week conversing about them, and maybe even involve dreaded _committees_. It’s so much work that it takes up a whole department. Much of the challenge for me comes from needing to remember all this crap about all these people.

It's inadequate to form forced relationships with coworkers solely because of your subject assignments. The same is true for sales, where often whole software products exist to track the personal information “needed” to close a deal for a wide range of prospects. These are really unnatural ways to squeeze together relationships which could form naturally through shared interest and open publications.

## Choice(s)

The first thing after Johan on my calendar/to-do list (close, physical) right now is to “politic Commissioner Peirce from Vegas,” extending a prior bump-together from years back where a blockchain TA was introduced but not materially discussed. For all intents and purposes, it’s a cold outreach very similar to my present interactions with Justin, COO at SDF. We’ve had like three interactions since early this year after briefly meeting last Consensus.

Much of this reflection stems from the recent community evolution of Emir into employment staff at the SCF. We've had extensive private discussions influenced by the late-2024 interleaving dialogues which benefitted his prior employer. The vast difference in tone with those chats woke me up to the ease with which I can communicate with the DRS community—a stark difference I've noticed for years now, given a misalignment of values compared to certain Stellar-Global sentiments.

I really appreciate the freedom I get to express on a daily basis through my work, a feeling which I see starkly thrown down in Emir’s public community-support work. At least from my personal view, Apes have these incredible direct communications really moving the ball forward at all costs—even at the highest levels—through public discourse. Comparatively, all the status updates from entrenched Foundation team members, including Emir’s announcement yesterday, feel like the backside of a local mayor winning for the second year in a row.

## Forum

I remember the Lumen Loop community X Space at the end of last year, when the AQUA rewards manipulation really came to a peak. There were three core devs in the call, who I called out by name. Just before they left the call, Justin popped up as a speaker and asked an ancillary-unrelated question, similar to the side-note from that one ECE girl.

With every ounce of respect due, I had thoroughly publicly commented on how Justin acted as a neutral arbiter on the interleaving discussion up to that point, and the substance of the present conversation revolved around DEX adoption. Given the contrasting viewpoints then voiced at Meridian, there wasn’t much for Justin to expand on past their present comments. It’s not that there couldn’t have been some vocal dialogue from them at that point, but it just wouldn’t have materially advanced the discussion of technical design considerations circa paths.

While this might’ve been a faster place to voice concerns, get viewpoints out, and have immediate discussion, the “recorded” Space was explicitly not the proper forum for protocol-level upgrades. Even if the recording didn’t mysteriously disappear (per X fault, IMO), it’s just not the proper medium to collaboratively construct network improvements. The same can be said for conversations with Commissions, especially through a private means such as email.

## Figureheads

The reason these individuals can sway perspective in a synchronous vocal communication stems from their position of “power” atop a bureaucracy designed to respect their “position.” This organization of humans presupposes that some people are more “trustworthy” than others. While this is true at a micro-interpersonal level, it simply doesn’t work well when forcibly applied unilaterally across thousands (or more) relationships.

The beauty of the community help sections stems from the reality that anyone can step up to respond to items they’re best equipped to answer. Indeed, even Justin replied to my [2023 doc ask](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/907476473739354153/1158791737565782199). Meaningfully, this interaction took over 24 hours—an unusually long amount of time for replies in the `help` channel.[^e]

The larger challenge for me comes from how I frame the outreach to Peirce in personal notes as “politicking” (ew, not a fun thing to do). Often I find that I spend material efforts reaching out to these central representatives only to find myself disappointed when they simply don’t have the expertise or domain passion to comprehensively uncover a solution. I like to think people generally put forth their best efforts, but it’s not reasonable to expect a select handful of individuals “at the top” to have the absolute best answers for everything.

## Haste

It is much faster to just talk to the people at the top, period. Super mega faster. I can think of far too many examples.[^f]

But these chats practically always glance over materially nuanced design details. An implementation based solely on such a condensed perspective practically always has flaws. And these policy holes create nightmares individual staff need to sort out years later.

Comparatively, a more decentralized, public-forum and context-based collaboration workflow maintains technical excellence. An example which comes to mind: Orbit’s work identifying a rounding bug in the DEX before a swift joint resolution—mimicking the security bounties explained by Tyler and Pasta.

# Pros

## Reaching out to Peirce as an end-of-term collaboration or discussion with Crypto Task Force

- Possible warm intro to the existing Commissioners  
- A smart person with a smart position on the CCP bailouts  
- Generally cool to chat with—perhaps we can work her perspective into the product. The regulators are technically a “buyer” of what we’re “selling” by building TAD3, although I’ve never really approached it like that before. They have such a strong tie-down to the existing laws that much of their responses could be easily interpreted by a rudimentary review of the case law.  
- The Commission could want to give us some guidance, and this could be an avenue to communicate such.  
- Promotes existing means of regulation by relationships  
- She is a smart person who will likely continue publishing great information to the public  
- Faster segue into roundtable discussions, getting DEX items on the regulatory agenda  
- Dash would traditionally see it as a good opportunity to “get in” with the group to build relationships for acceptance.  
- Insull was heavily involved with the top brass of local politics. He would've jumped at the chance to involve himself in regional policymaking. Notably, direct connections were his means of keeping the policies leaning toward his businesses.  
  - This is exactly the kind of outreach he would’ve made _later_ in his life when the physical natural monopoly constraints needed remediation.  
- Railroad equivalent would be taking a professional contract to dynamite some tunnels, quickly clearing the way without exploring the surrounding wilderness.  

## Circling back with Justin to get info on the private repos for detecting validator front-running (discussed with Garand)

- Faster, direct answer on existing pathfind analysis methods  
- Strengthens relationship with someone in the first-order loop of admired devs  
- Potentially understand internal workings of the SDF a little better, giving a “more complete” picture of the network  
- Very easy segue to media placements, central shoutouts, and community attention  
- Could start politicking for central control of fund distributions  

## Basically reaching out to "top brass" at other meaningful central institutions with hierarchies

- Easy initial introduction, especially as I become more well-known  
- Easy to put forth a single dominant, convincing viewpoint  
- Commands respect, results, and responses from other firms  
- Probably have some pretty damn good conversations and personally learn really cool things very quickly  
- Builds a name and reputation for myself and others which is relatively trivial to convert into material wealth  
- Gets “connections” which might prove useful on the actual political front if/when things get to that level  

# Cons

## Leaving Peirce to pursue her own private work thereafter, leaving two existing communications with CTF

- Redundant if the Commissioners are already on it?  
  - Possibility that outreach could prompt direct dialogue  
  - Is direct dialogue good?  
    - I recall the sinking feeling I made when posting in OCC that the Syndicate would continue taking on clients despite PREV n.4. It wasn’t appropriate, but it stemmed from the pressure-cooker environment the OCC artificially creates when the market collapses. It just always feels better to keep dialogue in public comments and receive a black-and-white public reply.  
    - Little material progress on the no-action letters  
    - Wouldn’t materially affect funding, presuming we can make the DUNA labor work  

- While not Peirce specifically, the admins and Commissioners need to come to their own conclusions to create lasting change. I don’t want something accepted this term and reversed in 2027. If they stumble into the tech themselves, we have years to free them into drafting their own policies  
- Any guidance shared wouldn’t be immediately in writing  
- Any communications would require significant drafting  
  - If we want to come across as professional, I would put in great effort to strictly cover points already discussed publicly  
  - Traditionally, this could fill someone’s full-time job—just figuring out ways to get an “in” with regulators  
  - This is a lot of effort to draft something the community might never even see, which I’ve presently reserved for explicit regulatory outreach when covering MNPI or PII  

- The material Dash relationships come from her own independent actions and direct submission through the established entrance means. There’s never some secret backdoor that opens for her, despite “above and beyond” efforts to politic the attention of figureheads. For the established group, it’s a common practice to ignore such requests on the basis of popularity  
- Insull’s political backdoor-ins caused a lot of problems later in life. He never really overcame the traction licensing quandaries for municipal railroads, which ended up in a problematic election-year narrative shift that began his sentiment downfall. He also relied heavily on central bankers for control and finance, acting quickly under the existing rules without questioning their intent  
  - Some could see the protectionist policies as competitive disenfranchisement  
- The slower path of written changelogs equates, in the railroad example, to demolishing the entire mountain to make way for civilizations to follow  

## Ghosting Justin and prospects of reviewing their validator analysis code, which could have pathfinding implications

- Cripples Syndicate into basis of front-running analysis from SDF  
- Better for ecosystem if multiple independent analysis forums exist, especially given the SDF’s initial technical skill in identifying their set analysis  
- Doesn’t fully develop our community understanding of validator trust implications, weakening regulatory nuance for DUNA  
- Vast majority of devs have shown _zero_ care for politicking or existing connections over technicals  
- Takes away time, distracting me from the meaningful and immediate interactions with the incredible community  
  - I like the community devs a lot more because we can just build things together without the permissioned layers apparent in hierarchies  
- Syndicate links to the SDF are generally a negative for regulatory analysis and policy governance of the DEX  
- Could get me off my defensive game when it comes to pointing out improper uses and control of the exchange mechanisms  
- Again, any direct links make the compliance suss-y and generally go against the principles of decentralization  
- I made a promise to myself that I’d stop politicking the SDF, and I _do_ believe in the NQG mechanism through SCF to distribute the lumens efficiently  
- Already wasted a ton of time directly politicking the hell out of figureheads with no results, knowing they don’t have the free ability to personally reply  

## Lol just only interacting with other firms through the procedural and public-posting methods available to individuals

- Removes a reliance on me (or others) as a central prerequisite figure  
- Keeps things permissionless, in the sense that anyone can join at any time and communicate on the same playing field as us  
- Have to talk to people and maybe even fly places to meet them 🤢  
- Prevents knowledge from building up in one person rather than being shared across the organization  
- Removes chokepoints in daily operations or policy analysis that concentrate power in a select few inside a proprietary walled garden  
- Reduces the risk of “culture spread” through others convincing us to move toward command-and-control structures  
  - (Although this also requires deeper analysis of working contributor intake)  
- I want to make things referenceable through stable URLs, which isn’t the case for personal conversations  
- Promotes having organizations structured unequally, with a select few on top making the management decisions  

# Call

Fuck their systems, man. If there are others in the community who want to involve themselves in all this bureaucratic crap, then by all means—good for them. But nah, this is just not a good trade for me. I'm just gonna do my thing through the open channels.  


[^a]: As in, they are not involved in the original founding, formative vision, or starting group. Even here, the line is not solid because central financing can turn this group much closer to daily salaried employees. And those considering their time by hourly wages practically always fall into this group.

[^b]: More practically speaking, what I’m really getting at is the number of degrees of separation from the market itself. The further isolated a "working bee" becomes from the market they serve, the worse this gets. That’s why we hear horror stories of CxOs making choices every "low-level" employee knows are horrible.

[^c]: An exception to this rule comes to mind in the early years of Valve, when play-testing was explicitly pushed as a chief priority. But again, here we have a collective organization mandate rather than the present disconnect on certain store policies unilaterally made by empowered employees. Also, these problems don't generally come out before five years of operations, which aligns with the timeframe for Portal 2.

[^d]: One notable exception that comes to mind was the crowdsourced contractor-style support ticketing deployed by ClickFunnels. Briefly, “experienced” users could self-elect to receive $2 per support ticket. They logged in freely and replied with their knowledge and feedback. Generally, these users were really good at what they explained, assisted with a central knowledge bank.

[^e]: I’ll also note that I’ve asked questions which simply never get a reply from any community member, even in cases when I re-reference it by bringing the channel up someplace else. In these cases, I’ve found that the substance of my question is simply too complex for a public answer, or I need to think through it myself more. When reflecting on query framing, I think back to college when I would spam the class discussion forms with questions I'd end up answering myself half the time (but many hours after posting), sort of like #13 in this repo implementing a design improvement. There, everyone from top students to the professors would chime in on the discussions I started with a strong question, providing a wealth of knowledge that’s both decentralized and “public”—the best kind of answer-finding.

### Edit

This was the right call. [Here](https://x.com/JFWooten4/status/1925017406000308391) I look foolish after [full context](https://x.com/gttyson/status/1926010532160537083). Notably, there's an RFC at the end (tagging a co-author and author of first consensus mechanism), establishing the requested discourse participants.

While I might not get an explicit callout from most bureaucracies, I've got to think DTC was doing something along these lines when they titled their presentation "The Great" something. These are some really nuanced traps they're laying, and I appreciate the opportunity to fall into a harmless one from the community first. Again, we might get this faster central response through explicit leadership prodding, but frankly, it's just lending credence to concepts I don't care about or [want adopted](https://x.com/gttyson/status/1925652074471055574) over superior infrastructure.
