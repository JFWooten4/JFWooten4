Should we settle for this execution cost? Please, may I frame it against your economic interest? 

Thanks for stating on the detauils of an important topic Mark's beem exploruinf for a long time, 6days. I'm th fiunder of the referenced company and spend a loy of my time inthe community. I appreciate what Byrne did for the uindustry, and it sounds like my goals align with Alan in certain regaurds.

Our technology employes decentralized exchamge, and there's a big differenve of form in tbar defi vs. an ATS. I'll just refer to that exchange business under the umbrella of the entire broker incl the corresponsdant cyustodian with crypto, Obviously I'd expect you understand ther differemnces in depth, but I'll spell it out for public transparency.

I agree that th goal is compliance, but for me it's also protectiung the public beyond certain limited NMS rules. I've talked to a lot of trading firm executives, and the ,atter of brokering always cones down to business model. This shouldnt syprise anyone, as tZERO pays its sharehikdera with the 1% tradibng fee.

I am in the camp that thius is too high a fee.


My first speaking engaement for BT was 




We we re in the midst of an exam when this came up, but I;ve been looking and thinking all day now. I can get pretty off the rials when I spend too mcuh time in the centrlaized cusotdy structre, so I'm going to ease off other analysis like this going forward. But I appreciate what Byrne did and want to support those goals like Alan.

I remember one of my firste xperinces in the industr on a peanel with executives running two other ATS brokers at https://youtu.be/DGhZcFbbJik?t=1281. Proffitt even talks about doing t+0 through the SPBD almost four years ago. 




Bosth others spekaeers introduced their ATS as a business model, which we have here with tZERO. Ther'es a huge difference of form in these central exchanges with defi sssytems. They present two exeuction locations which are stricttly mutulaly exclusive.





There  are some deeper issues Amrk brings up XYZ_ABC. @DTCC doesn't just throw 140 people into a conference call for n o reason.
