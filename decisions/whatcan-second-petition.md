I'm dealing with what could be my most centralized decisions yet. For setup context, we have still not received a response from the Commission in re Exam 1 findings after the interim review meeting prior to final call. This is a great thing, which was highly praised in https://github.com/JFWooten4/gratitude-journal/blob/main/2025/Jul/30.md[^1]

[^1]: This perfectly exemplifies the root of the matter, which is that I've become too central to the regulatory interactions and broader policy discourse. It needs to center around Syndivate public policies and collective operating principles rather than my view.

The essence of the quandary stems around how quickly I want to tie the interweaving knot between all these established relationships. I'm going to take my time given an impending circumstance, because I've known about them and prepared deeply for so long.

## Context

I've started feeling this way since I went down the coffee route to get the last pending items out in accordance with centralized deadlines. There was one Saturday post-submission where I was practically shaking the whole day, constantly intaking calories to even moderately satiate my energy needs to think.

I'm going to try changing sleep schedules to get myself back into a more comfortable place, but for the immediate moment, I have a very short window to choose and act on this time. It revolves entirely around the last week of prep we've done in getting WhatCan's principled thoughts into a stellar [petition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1mhdxrs/petition_to_close_regsho_loopholes_allowing).

### Options

I could not send the letter, leaving staff completely uninterrupted in their oversight process. Presumably, this would mean also not reaching out prematurely to Donna to speak on overarching items and regulatory sentiments.

I'm trying deeply to figure out how to remove myself from this equation and let community collaboration flourish.

### Interim Call

I'm going to give Donna a call later today and get a little more context on the positioning after discussion with the other Examiner that's worked with "blockchain" TA. I like calling "low-level" staff most akin to direct engineers because we have an actual legitimate working relationship together. I don't equate it to politicking because I already know them and we've conversed before.

### Nonresponsive Feedback

Unfortunately (and fortunately), I didn't hear from Donna and am still in the cold waiting phase until our last meeting to go over the Exam results. I'm glad for the expanded scope and comprehensive review, not to mention some time to get sticky notes from physical to notetaking form. This leaves me in my standard frame for all these years: interpreting.

One reading with sufficient evidence-based backing can take the cake. I'm very pleased with how Examinations are in themselves a staff reading of the hard framework laws. Thus, I find myself here at the drawing board in solace, a common comforting zone.

## Factors

### Pros (drafting cover and sending)

- Embed a personal narrative  
  - Connect to existing work  
  - Add date for references  
  - Backlink to PREV  
- Add color to the swatch of strikeouts  
- Adds to overall petitioner support and justification  
- Add diversity to community perspectives with strong basis  
- Chance to throw a timestamp on the FAC points not known  
- Back an established, passionate voice doing much good  

### Cons (submitting only WC template from john@whydrs email)

- Imposes my own credit onto WC's work-product (can be minimized by only signing last page or staying anonymous)  
- Somewhat shows distrust in standalone performance  
- Name and imaging irrevocably associated with WhyDRS  
  - Good thing long term but a big jump for staff here at start  
  - Can establish links at cost of a hasty judgment turnaround  
  - Begins challenging work of disentangling and removing conflicts  
- Narrative changes risk alienating original draft sentiments  
- Centralized in the sense of pushing a direct narrative over and above thoughtful prodding through discarded questions  

## Logic

I really hate politicking; I'm just so sick of it. It's an insane amount of mental bandwidth, and so often it's literally for naught. I am happy that I spent so much time and effort getting my first impressions correct with the five feminine organizations which matter in my life. But like bruh sincerely I could not give another single flying fuck about how people view my work.

## Call

Lol let's do it.  
The worst case here is not even a fricking case at all.
