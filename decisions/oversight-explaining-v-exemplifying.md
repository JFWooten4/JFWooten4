It feels nice to be back in this repo folder. These last months have been so many decisions with PII or MNPI that make it impossible for me to draft in public. But luckily I think most of that is well behind me now and we'll have all the publication out.

I'm at a really tough crossroads (but where the road starts splitting) between my DRS and XLM work. Or at least, it's a railroad siding that runs parallel for some distance before reconnecting. The core challenge is the sheer amount of pending work in the Deficiency letter response.

I very seriously contemplated attending a community event some distance away during the review period due on Sep 15. I won't pull punches or politic you through how that decision was made. A happenstance of factors led to a logistical inconvenience which I took as a sign to abandon outreach.

That said, I'm still left with material community outreach on both sides, and I'm having a really challenging qualm between prioritizing my _very centralized work_ getting this framework and factual evidence back to the Commission. The essence for me is **explaining vs. accepting** the reality I'm describing to them. It's whether I should lean into decentralized work that brings the whole ecosystem forward or my own statutory obligations.

## Pros[^1]

[^1]: For clarity, the decision at stake is whether to engage with Hunter in the immediate response period to their outreach, likely entailing a phone call. I still need to circle around with the government numbering office to get a solid reference for ยง 1 of the reply. That alone could take up two days of social bandwidth.

- Already engaging in a community call on Friday:
  - With Chives and WhatCan
  - Framed around getting to the bottom of FAST reporting discrepancies
  - Not exactly something I am immediately authoritatively needed to assist, but rather done for the explorative and political purposes of the Hunter chat
- Deepen a really great relationship where we're both making big strides to get network funding right
- They are really smart, and did I mention they are working on really cool stuff despite huge challenges
- Inlay to Silence working items through Atlas dev group, which has direct links to the Foundation
  - Not sure and almost a con in the latter part
  - Existing developments incomplete with Bri and inside team on docs
  - Outside of public forum and refreshes the time clock on backdated references for Dash
- Very strong [historical outreach](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/911254664576643122/1362183910309757120)

## Cons

- In the DRS example, I have a whole new collaborator to gain 
  - Extremely similar overlap of existing work
  - Same interests in investigation and reform
  - Not really the case with Hunter, who I sponsor
- Crux of the item is my lacking frameworks for collective working item remuneration, and I dislike requesting efforts with no avenue for compensation in any of its forms
- Could probably happen later, albeit with less timely rigor
- Could deter existing narrative which is at least 2 months backlogged by the SEC burden
- Take material time away from the response which just keeps expanding in scope
- Risks missing something timestamped which could be a backlink in TAR2
- The historical outreach extends NQWG and SCF work rather than the immediate needed SEC reply
  - To the textnet relative, this is probably the most scrutiny _I_ will have as the independent coordinator of all the Syndicate efforts
  - Getting it right therefore with the same prudence as past judicial arguments made in condensed timeframes would set an exceptional precedent
  - As a counter, I don't know how often we'll see Steve once we move to Indiana oversight sector, but I believe they would still cross-ref

## Call

This is really hard because every instinct in my heart says to perform the community outreach and continue growing together. I just absolutely hate how these centralized deadlines arbitrarily force me into binds.[^2] You know, the Commission has been quite satisfied with plan layouts and public references, so I say let's squeeze it in and say hi to the start of technical delegation.

[^2]: And it's not like they don't help get things across the finish line. _See, e.g.,_ the expedited TAR1 comment termination, which itself cut off in the genesis material DEX documentation work still outstanding. But it's a matter of form that's more intimately violated, taking the locus of control away from creative collaborator liberties.
