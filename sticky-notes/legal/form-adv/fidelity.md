# Designated Investments Agreement
Fidelity has designated certain investment products identified as more complex and/or higher risk as “Designated Investments”. I understand that from time to time Fidelity may accept orders for Designated Investments only from self-directed, sophisticated, experienced investors who (1) have represented to Fidelity that they do their own investment research and analysis and (2) agree not to rely to any extent upon Fidelity for advice, guidance, information, direction or recommendations relating to these investments. I understand I must agree to this Designated Investments Agreement in order to open positions in such investments through Fidelity. I understand that this Designated Investments Agreement applies to any and all investments that Fidelity has designated or may in the future designate as a Designated Investment. I understand that the Designated Investments list may be updated from time to time without notice to me. I acknowledge that many complex or highly risky products are not on the Designated Investments list and that even though one or more products are not on the Designated Investments list does not mean that they are not complex or highly risky. I am not relying on Fidelity to identify all such complex or risky investments. Before making any investment, I understand I should review and understand each investment and its benefits and risks. By clicking "I Agree" below, I represent and agree:

I am a sophisticated, experienced investor;
My risk tolerance is high, I can afford to lose some or all of any investment I make in a Designated Investment, and I have sufficient resources at Fidelity or elsewhere to sustain such losses;
I am responsible for educating myself regarding Designated Investments, including reading the applicable offering documents (including, where applicable, the prospectus and statement of additional information) and any disclosures provided by Fidelity, if any, before I invest so that I am aware of their investment objectives, unique features and risks as well as their fees and expenses;
I independently analyze the risks of investing in Designated Investments and have the sophistication and experience to do so. I make my own investment decisions and will do so as to all Designated Investments I may transact through Fidelity;
Fidelity does not, and I understand will not, advise, recommend or solicit any transaction in a Designated Investment. To the extent I will have or have had communications with any Fidelity representatives about a Designated Investment, I agree not to rely on those communications as advice, guidance, recommendations, or solicitations;
I have not, and will not, rely on Fidelity or any Fidelity representative for advice, guidance, information or recommendations regarding Designated Investments, their nature or features, their risk profiles or their suitability for me;
I understand Fidelity will not monitor my Designated Investment holdings and I am not relying today and will not rely in the future on Fidelity to monitor my Designated Investment holdings or advise me concerning them; and
I will promptly inform Fidelity if any of these representations are no longer true
I understand and agree that Fidelity will rely on my representations above as a condition to accepting an order in a Designated Investment from me, and that I am bound by them as to my account(s).
