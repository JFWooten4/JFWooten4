## Context

I need to run to the end of 723, which consists of the remaining SDEX and custodial-signatures work. The multisig items have zero existing efforts outside of the years of experience. The SDEX part hinges on a timely response from Johan for documenting pathfinding.

I've started a draft with significant prior context on the assistance plea, which I think would land more squarely with the S-D#1496 in an expanded flow. If I give an example of adding a page for `ManageData` there, I have a really strong basis to ask for their help doing the same. Good idea no matter what.

## Matter at Hand

Whether or not to have a reflection day before starting the final run-through, but after the routing help.

## Pros

- Some time to relax
- Mentally map out how we want to conclude all the info
- Review internally the political points which were crucially included in my present CA
- Speed comes from adequate preparation
- John happy easy quick way

## Cons

- Slower
- Potentially a day off the end to finish the signatures
  - This or more rush during the SDEX part
  - Generally, my plan is to comprehensively complete the SDEX page before even considering moving into multisig
    - Multisig is already pretty complete
    - There's a lot of new stuff with Soroban authorization which is in a completely separate documentation page
    - Still a real question based on March exchange with Tyler as to the interposition of classic and Soroban signers
- Relatively duplicative of the after-TAR1/SEC-reply time away
- Do I really need more time to prepare for the terminus, given this is pretty mechanical work rather than inspired?
  - It really stems from the technical points, but I just care about them far too much

## Call

The next thing I have to implement (lol post-gov) is how to implement the EDGAR Next API, so let's get this out, reflect after it's done but before the traversal, and then that gives them a full 24 extra hours to review things.
