I'm sorry to break your heart‚Äîsomebody out there has already come up with the same idea that you have. Somebody out there is already working on the same idea that you have. Don't overindex on the idea. Instead, find out what it is that they know that you don't. Because ideas are hardly new. What's new is solving an unsolved problem in an existing idea... You first need to learn... Your idea is not your startup. Your approach is your startup.

The US Small Business Administration will tell you: The single biggest reason small businesses fail is that they did not have a written business plan... Let me ask you this: have you ever had a house custom built? If you did, I'll bet you hired an architect and had him draw up a set of plans. But why? Didn't you have an experienced builder?... The plan is the indispensable piece of the puzzle, because the plan is the magic formula.

"Small is great. It's really the best. No big team has ever built‚Äîin software‚Äîanything meaningful.

It's always a small team. It's always a small group of people. It's always a small group of people that have zero process, or very low process, and flat organizations‚Äîand those are the best times...

We are really hiring only the people we need and we know we're going to need for a long period of time, rather then overhiring prematurely. Because I think that that, in 9 times out of 10, leads to premature death of companies. And so staying small for as long as possible is really actually a massively underrated competitive advantage.

You know,
When you scale past a certain stage you don't have 100% of people who are there because they believe in the mission. You start to have people who are there because they think it's a good paycheck and they have stability and good health care plans.

"DTC is not chiefly a holder of securities in safe custody, but rather an automated bookkeeping system providing multiple services leading to, or stemming from, the custody of securities."

Worth noting that he was selected largely because he had been the state superintendent of New York banks for 2 years

"I wanted that bored to be composed of executives from depository users for the greatest extent possible, and answerable only to users."

"In 1983 we became aware that a stock loan finder bribe to DTC night-shift supervisor in the settlement department to make a fraudulent entry directing stock valued at $750,000 to a brokerage firm." (Dentzer)

The depository confronted its first failure to settle in 1973 when Weiss
Securities failed to pay for securities delivered to its account... On May 18th, 1982, Drysdale Securities Corporation posted a similar problem, unable to pay us its $4.5 million debit... On a few other occasions, we reversed several deliveries to a Participant that was unable to pay at settlement obligations.

"In traditional markets built upon a business model that's multiple centuries old, you and I are not members directly of the New York Stock Exchange. We have to go through somebody to get to the New York Stock Exchange. That's called a broker... But in these crypto markets, everybody can access directly the markets. The markets actually, interestingly, have to have a much more robust API for the retail public... a very different architecture, where it's disintermediated the broker-dealers... Will we see a direct access model at any exchange around the globe, or will we stay in the intermediated access?"

The year 1975 also brought the initial sale of DTC stock as envisioned under BASIC's plan. Enough states had modified their laws to make it possible for the NYSE to sell some of its 100 percent ownership. Bank Participants were offered entitlement to purchase depository stock based on BASIC's ownership formula defining depository usage. Since BASIC had contemplated that the NYSE, the American Stock Exchange (Amex), and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) would own DTC stock on behalf of their member broker-dealers, the Amex and NASD also bought shares. The resulting ownership of DTC stock was: NYSE 61 percent, Amex and NASD eight percent each, and 21 banks with a total of 23 percent. The principle of user ownership had begun to be implemented.
After bank users of DTC had purchased stock, some broker-dealers saw no reason why they should not be able to do so also,

Yet when in 1981 I suggested reducing the weight given to long positions in the ownership formula, Wriston rebuffed me. The undue weight given to long positions in the formula had given New York banks entitlement to four board seats, up from three, and could generate more bank seats later. Wriston did not consider that a problem.

After being stymied then, I forged a consensus several years later that modified the ownership formula by reducing the weight of long-position market value in two stages: to 40 percent in 1987 and to 20 percent in 1988, with correspondingly greater weight given to fees paid to the depository.

I later won DTC board agreement that in its nominations for election of directors by stockholders, broker-dealers (including their representatives) would have seven seats and banks (including their representatives) would have seven seats, up from three.

Ok what if you set up a payment app scheme... There are no fees charged to the merchant or the consumer... However the merchant is probably directly responsible for chargebacks... Or potentially you could see how it works and maybe especially at the start not charge them for the chargebacks... And the idea is that the money sits in an intermediate account for 60 days after purchase, where it's invested in risk-free assets... And then you could pay the cardholders like 80% of the interest, potentially covering all the chargebacks with the last 20%... And then you give the company their funds after the 60 days  
Win-win? Potentially give consumers the rate of fed funds as their card percent cash back, on all purchases ‚Äì but maybe through like a more efficient mobile means? Maybe payments don't have to be hard? But you would have to certainly establish all of that outside of the traditional card transaction schema. Tech

Lincoln followed the regimen that he would prescribe 24 years later to a young man who asked him how to gain a thorough knowledge of the law. Lincoln replied, the mode is very simple, though laborious and tedious. It is only to get the books and read, and study them carefully... Work, work, work is the main thing... my judgment is that he reads the books for himself without an instructor. That is precisely the way I came to the law.

"Finally, one senior customer service rep took pity on me and called me back on her cell phone, presumably to avoid the call being recorded internally, and told me that according to their system, I had been red flagged as a potential money launderer, and that there was no specific transaction. Someone in the government had sent my bank a little heads-up... Yet, as I was later to learn, despite not presenting a single shred of evidence, the government had no problem convincing a magistrate judge to sign off on the money laundering charge in the complaint. Imagine what that did to me. Try living day-to-day in our society with no bank account or credit cards. Try paying your mortgage every month with a money order from CVS. That was bad, but by far, the worst of it was the damage the government‚Äôs hardball tactics inflicted on Lisa‚Äôs catering business. Her checks to vendors bounced, she couldn‚Äôt pay staff, and she wasted countless hours trying unfreeze her accounts and credit cards. It severely damaged her business. At the time, her business was the only thing putting food on our table."

"There was nothing else to compare this to. No precedent to call upon. This was a financial 9/11. Capitalism, efficient market theory, our entire regulatory structure‚Äîall said that what had just happened to Bear Stearns was impossible.

The discussion about making things more transparent in the art market is really interesting, because it sort of feels like the market depends on a lack of transparency‚Äîthat that's part of the appeal. If everyone had all of the information about these up-and-coming artists and how much they might be worth in that 6-to-8 year period, or however long it takes, it would really eliminate the value of the intermediaries that keep the whole thing going.

I'm very deep in the, "who cares about the unregulated art market" gang. This seems to me to be a very small group of rich people who should do their own self-regulation. And that the regular law around contracts and fraud should cover them perfectly well otherwise. The idea that this is in the top... policy priorities basically anywhere in the world seems crazy to me.

OpenAI and its governance structure (kind of to have this board of trustees, the board that oversees the company) was an attempt at self-regulation. And that apparently did not work, and you can discuss that at length‚Äîwhy it did not work, but it is clear that it was wanting []. And I think it's gonna push people personally to debate more towards government regulation because it makes clear that that's kind of a genuine task here for the government to do‚Äîto regulate that technology.
