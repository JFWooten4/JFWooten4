I need some naming rules to keep clean boundaries. Anything for normal work is just `wooten`

### Introductions

| Person is girl
|   Could this relationship have a clear, immediate, business purpose?
|     Yes
|       switch venue:
|         con -> n64retro
|         PT -> n64retro
|         online form -> existing intro
|     No
|       switch resationship status:

|         married -> john
|         unknown -> n64retro
| Pone is boy
