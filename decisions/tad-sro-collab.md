# Syndicate Policy Construction Standards

I need to decide whether or not to make TAD3 an inter-agent standard.

What does it mean to control someone? Would you call the law of the land control, given its explicit-_ish_ scope of penalties? Or perhaps you’d think of the monetary system as a control mechanism?

A fear of imprisonment or worse certainly instills due fear in most people to halt physical crime. But what about the fraud so commonplace in financial intermediaries? Do we call this _idem_ crime, or is it a more nuanced form of behavior that is much more challenging to assert?

In contemplating the Ad rules, it’s become abundantly clear that the relationship of trust historically stewarded by our elected representatives has geometrically deteriorated over the decades. Unfortunately, these oversight processes do not seem adept to handle today’s growing market complexity. Given that much of my ambitions circle around integrating billions into capital markets, I must contemplate what could be the best option for a next generation not encumbered (or otherwise _civis protectus_) by a select few three-letter agencies.

Indeed, these established institutions preferentially ingrained in our market plumbing fail to adequately protect investors abroad, and vice versa for foreign governments and their own instituted inefficiencies.[^xml] Might the cost of these often corrupted paths outweigh the historic niceties they’ve instilled in markets past? I just don’t think a centralized solution will best serve us all.

[^xml]: _See, e.g.,_ the rule that all British merger proxies must be sent as a full package through post to all investors. Policies like these are demonstrably ruinous for our environment, for no reason in modern contexts. Might we establish a better way that works for these billions of new people?

## Pros (Making it an open standard)

- 

## Cons (Set only for the Syndicate)[^code]

---

## Call

[^code]: Albeit the code repos and such probably shouldn’t move, and all that is fine as it stands for security concerns.
