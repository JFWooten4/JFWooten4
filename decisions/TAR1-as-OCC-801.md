Okay, so we've got a pretty pivotal decision here. The matter at hand is whether or not to redirect the existing TAR1 comment to the OCC's 802 rule closing May 18. That is a terminus date, but if memory serves, the Commission stays on the deadlines for SRO filings like this.

If you're looking back at this from some time in the future, here is the relevant discussion: [GitHub](https://github.com/WhyDRS/SEC-Comments/discussions/14)

This presently has been implemented in months and months of work [here](https://github.com/WhyDRS/SEC-Comments/tree/31ded54461797c23bef39d5fb218c23f7047d546/TAR-S7-27-15). For the remainder of this analysis, I will write based on memory rather than explicit references to existing work or the proposed/concept/amending-release rules.

### Background of two options

Ignoring the easy answer of a simple HTML comment referencing upcoming work in TAR.

#### OCC Adoption

They are amending the master repurchase agreement placed in 2002 as the setup for the repo agreements of underlying positional collateral. Generally, this is part of the ongoing play to overmargin everyone with cross-CCP arrangements which require a systemic bailout, saving pensioners according to WhatCan.[^deference] After some minimal outreach to the select few apes really involved in the nuance here afaik, it looks like it'll be challenging to get everyone's timeframes together, which is relevant because the comment period here has very real ramifications.

I spent Friday affirming this position.

#### TAR Concept

Asks for general concepts of a future market structure without consideration of risk implications. This is also generally true for departing Commissioner Peirce's "We Can Get This Right" speech.

[^deference]: I've been reviewing WhatCan's work these last couple days and, as communicated to them privately, can't believe we haven't collaborated before. I'd really like to just have them help out directly with the comment on GitHub. Let me try giving them a call.[^resp]

[^resp]: Nothing there yet. I understand that they have other work (?) and so pretty reasonable, as is with all the incredible community members. I really appreciate the recent help from Cats and Bob, which I would never have uncovered without the sustainability support from Chives. ðŸ’œ Others might not see it as much, but I deeply appreciate the gesture and read volumes from it as a market allocation incentive of outstanding percents.

## Pros (stay on S7-27-15)

- It's a really, really important file number which I would personally just feel so much better commenting on in the future.
- It would fill my heart with joy and happiness as satiation fills my body.
- I've been working on it under the scope here for over a year, albeit without deference to the original questions, which have stayed as open GitHub issues.
- Wouldn't need to mess around with James' issue tracker project because this is technically a completely different file number if swapping.
- Would be honest in the sense that I would follow through on what I've been promising people.
- Hur dur it's faster.
- It's easier (again).
- I don't have to deal with actually saving everyone from the impending shitstorm, and I can just say, I was right and now listen to my great safe scheme.

## Cons (swap to OCC-801)

- AN filing must consider bigger things than a normal rule change, such as the entire market's structure.
  - 805(b) of Dodd-Frank would let me directly bullet-point:
    - Robust risk management
    - Safety and soundness
    - Financial stability
    - Systemic risk
- Even though I went to comment on S7-27-15, I always knew rewriting TAR1 that it would not answer the 400 specific questions which I have immense insight into given my experience at the Syndicate. Their existing questions are excellent starting prompts which could give me exceptional room to tell innovation stories inspiring change. As it stands now, I'll need to do a second comment on the same rule number without the presupposition of them taking it seriously enough to start a whole new rule changing process.
  - That last part is not likely under Atkinsâ€”plain and simple, especially given links to Securrency.
  - If they follow a less involved refresh of comment periods, any following letter would still require the same rule number in the reply, which gets me to the double-commenting quotation problem I originally planned to avoid with the "TAR2" coming from the Syndicate. But this is honestly quite duplicative and could weaken the "countjioned stelar operantus" methodology and ethos.
- Passive-aggressive, indirect, and lamentable. It would read much more like a personal anecdote without addressing literally 96% of the raised questions directly. That's a strategy I've attempted through the past off-topic business footnotes, which failed spectacularly. This would give me the chance to grab the largest item I'm dealing with (_Great Taking_) and drag it around by the balls while forecasting the collapse they've planned.
  - Option A: we save investors and push their shit back another year (damn did the original OCC work save us _months_?!)
  - Option B: forced through, systemic collapse, and then a much stronger base to write from in TAR2.
- I have been personally pushing this off for so, so long because I wanted and needed to get it right. Those have always been the words, and this just seems like the perfect third stair to raise up the guillotine.
- These MFs would walk out of a complete change with _everything_. All the assets, all the politicians, and all the control. They could rug humanity just like they did in the '29 credit crunch and fuck it all up for everyone for decades to squander other nations.

## Call

Let's fuck their shit up, stir it around hot, and pour their asses on the concrete via OCC-2025-801.
