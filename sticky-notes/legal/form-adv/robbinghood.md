# Robinhood Legend General Disclosure and Acknowledgement

Robinhood Legend is intended to be a real-time analysis and trading platform. Robinhood Legend may have different features, use different data sources, and support a different set of products than the Robinhood mobile app and Robinhood classic web experience. You acknowledge that you have also reviewed Robinhood’s general 
terms and conditions
 of using our service. This Robinhood Legend General Disclosure and Acknowledgement (“Disclosure”) and its terms may be supplemented or amended from time to time by Robinhood by notice to you, and such notice requirement may be satisfied by the revised terms being posted on Robinhood’s 
Disclosure Library
. By continuing to utilize the Robinhood Legend platform, you are deemed to have accepted the terms of the revised Disclosure and will be legally bound by its terms and conditions.

Prior to proceeding, please take a moment to review and acknowledge the following important disclosures related to your use of the Robinhood Legend platform:

This Disclosure outlines the terms and conditions regarding your Brokerage Account(s) and/or your IRA Account(s) custodied with Robinhood Securities, LLC (“RHS”) and/or the account opened by Robinhood Crypto, LLC (“RHC”) on your behalf (“RHC Account”). “You,” “Customer,” and “your” refer to the customer who has opened a Brokerage Account and/or IRA Account custodied with RHS and/or a RHC Account. Your IRA and/or Brokerage Account(s) is held with an approved non-bank custodian (“RHS”), and securities transactions are completed through our introducing broker-dealer Robinhood Financial LLC (“RHF”). This Disclosure should be read in addition to the other agreements governing your accounts with RHF, RHS, and RHC.

System response and account access times and feature availability may vary due to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system performance, scheduled downtime, and other factors.

You understand and acknowledge that many capabilities of the Robinhood Legend Product Offering (“Robinhood Legend”) may be different than what is offered via Robinhood mobile app or “Robinhood classic” (i.e., the traditional web product available via logging into robinhood.com). Important securities and cryptocurrency details that are usually visible on an instrument’s details page via mobile app or Robinhood classic are not available in Robinhood Legend. This includes various product details such as Key Statistics, Full Order History, prospectus information for certain securities, company earnings, and analyst ratings. If you would like to view such information, you can use the mobile app or login to Robinhood classic on robinhood.com.

In addition, as of January 2025, you understand that i) your trade confirmation and statements will be accessible via mobile app and Robinhood classic, but not on the Robinhood Legend platform; ii) your Dividend Reinvestment (“DRIP”) and Recurring Investments orders (pending and filled) will not be viewable on the Recent Orders Widget on Robinhood Legend; iii) Joint Accounts are not supported on Robinhood Legend; and iv) Futures are not available on Robinhood Legend. You also understand that i) certain cryptocurrencies that are normally tradable via mobile app or Robinhood classic are not tradable on Robinhood Legend; ii) cryptocurrency transfers are not supported on Robinhood Legend; and iii) cryptocurrency trading on Robinhood Legend may not be available in all states.

The average cost displayed in Robinhood Legend may not always include fees, adjustments resulting from wash sales, corporate actions, and transfers through the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATs). Therefore, this calculation may not match your tax forms, if applicable. Average cost should not be used to determine your realized gain or loss for tax reporting purposes.

Important note about Robinhood Legend Options Trading: When closing an options position, particularly a multi-leg position, Robinhood Legend will name the order solely based on the contracts in the order and not on the position or strategy being acted upon. This is different from the experience in the mobile app or on Robinhood classic, where the order's name reflects the position being acted upon.

You should review RHF’s Fee Schedule for information regarding any fees associated with trading products offered through RHF.

Robinhood Legend Tools

Metrics and tools on Robinhood Legend (collectively "Tools") are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be used or construed as investment advice, financial guidance, or an offer, solicitation, or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security, commodities future, futures option, cryptocurrency, or other instrument.

The Tools (e.g., widgets) may prepopulate a single stock or cryptocurrency when you first use Robinhood Legend or if the Tools are unable to load your previous settings. In addition, when using the search function, the Tools may prepopulate popular stocks or popular cryptocurrency. You understand that the prepopulation of such stock or cryptocurrency is purely for informational purposes and is not investment advice or a recommendation to buy, hold, or sell any security or cryptocurrency. The methodology according to which a single stock will be prepopulated is based on the following considerations: i) the most commonly held U.S. listed single stocks held by Robinhood customers (i.e., not an ETF nor an ETN); ii) the exclusion of Robinhood Markets, Inc.’s own stock (NASDAQ: HOOD); iii) the existence of an underlying options market (i.e., stocks without an options market will be excluded); and iv) a start of day market capitalization of greater than $1 billion. Once you have used the Tools on Robinhood Legend, the Tools may prepopulate to an instrument that you searched using the Tools or an instrument otherwise referenced on a Tool you used. The cryptocurrencies that will be prepopulated in the search function will be the cryptocurrencies that are most commonly held by RHC customers and are available to trade on Robinhood Legend. This set of popular cryptocurrencies is generated using Robinhood data, not overall market data, and reflects the behavior of RHC customers as of the end of the prior fiscal quarter. The inclusion of these cryptocurrencies in the Search feature is not a recommendation or solicitation to buy, hold, or sell any cryptocurrency in your RHC account.

The Tools are not designed to yield variable results specific to your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, or investment goals, and none of the Tools should be relied upon in any way to determine the suitability of an investment or transaction for you. Before buying or selling any instrument, you should carefully consider your individual financial situation, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs, and consult licensed financial and tax professionals to determine for yourself whether the transaction is suitable for you.

Robinhood Lists are provided for informational purposes only by Robinhood Markets, Inc., and are not investment advice or a recommendation to buy, hold, or sell any security or cryptocurrency. The lists are generated using Robinhood data, not overall market data. Robinhood Lists are not personalized recommendations, and the securities or cryptocurrencies listed may not be suitable for you. You should not buy or sell anything on the Robinhood List without first determining it is appropriate for your portfolio or investment strategy.

My First List may be prepopulated with sample stocks to demonstrate the functionality of Robinhood Legend. The 16 stocks included in your prepopulated list are a combination of the following 2 lists: 1) The 8 stocks most traded on Robinhood within 30 days of joining. 2) The 8 stocks most commonly added to a Robinhood watchlist within 30 days of joining, exclusive of stocks that appeared in the first list. These lists are generated using Robinhood data, not overall market data, and reflect the behavior of customers who joined between September 2021 and February 2022. You can remove these stock symbols from your list and add any others of your choosing. The inclusion of prepopulated symbols in your list is not a recommendation or solicitation to buy, hold, or sell any security in your Robinhood Financial account.

The information provided on Robinhood Legend is for general informational purposes only and is not an individualized recommendation of any security, cryptocurrency, or investment strategy.
